[Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548)

Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.

[Setuid and Setgid](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001)

An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user�s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. Normally an application is run in the current user�s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)

[Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)

Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003)

[Sudo and Sudo Caching](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003)

Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/004)

[Elevated Execution with Prompt](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/004)

Adversaries may leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials. The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating. This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)

[Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)

Adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources. Many cloud environments allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges that may be distinct from their own.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/006)

[TCC Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/006)

Adversaries can manipulate or abuse the Transparency, Consent, & Control (TCC) service or database to execute malicious applications with elevated permissions. TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).

[T1134](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134)

[Access Token Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134)

Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)

[Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)

Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using DuplicateToken or DuplicateTokenEx. The token can then be used with ImpersonateLoggedOnUser to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with SetThreadToken to assign the impersonated token to a thread.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)

[Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)

Adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as CreateProcessWithTokenW and runas.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

[Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the LogonUser function. The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use SetThreadToken to assign the token to a thread.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)

[Parent PID Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)

Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the CreateProcess API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use. This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via svchost.exe or consent.exe) rather than the current user context.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005)

[SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005)

Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute , allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).

[T1531](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531)

[Account Access Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531)

Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users. Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: changed credentials) to remove access to accounts. Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or perform a [System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529) to set malicious changes into place.

[T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)

[Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email addresses on a system or within a compromised environment. This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, which can aid in follow-on behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers (e.g., [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/001)

[Local Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/001)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system accounts. This information can help adversaries determine which local accounts exist on a system to aid in follow-on behavior.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/002)

[Domain Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/002)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of domain accounts. This information can help adversaries determine which domain accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior such as targeting specific accounts which possess particular privileges.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/003)

[Email Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/003)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of email addresses and accounts. Adversaries may try to dump Exchange address lists such as global address lists (GALs).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/004)

[Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/004)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of cloud accounts. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application.

[T1098](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098)

[Account Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098)

Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)

[Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)

Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/002)

[Additional Email Delegate Permissions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/002)

Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)

[Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)

An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant. For example, adversaries may update IAM policies in cloud-based environments or add a new global administrator in Office 365 environments. With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings (including the ability to reset the passwords of other admins).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004)

[SSH Authorized Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004)

Adversaries may modify the SSH authorized\_keys file to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management. The authorized\_keys file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the user's home directory under <user-home>/.ssh/authorized\_keys. Users may edit the system�s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value "yes" to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled. The SSH config file is usually located under /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005)

[Device Registration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005)

Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/006)

[Additional Container Cluster Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/006)

An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled user or service account to maintain persistent access to a container orchestration system. For example, an adversary with sufficient permissions may create a RoleBinding or a ClusterRoleBinding to bind a Role or ClusterRole to a Kubernetes account. Where attribute-based access control (ABAC) is in use, an adversary with sufficient permissions may modify a Kubernetes ABAC policy to give the target account additional permissions.

[T1650](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1650)

[Acquire Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1650)

Adversaries may purchase or otherwise acquire an existing access to a target system or network. A variety of online services and initial access broker networks are available to sell access to previously compromised systems. In some cases, adversary groups may form partnerships to share compromised systems with each other.

[T1583](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)

[Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)

Adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain infrastructure that can be used during targeting. A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services. Some infrastructure providers offer free trial periods, enabling infrastructure acquisition at limited to no cost. Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)

[Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)

Adversaries may acquire domains that can be used during targeting. Domain names are the human readable names used to represent one or more IP addresses. They can be purchased or, in some cases, acquired for free.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/002)

[DNS Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/002)

Adversaries may set up their own Domain Name System (DNS) servers that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: [Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)). Instead of hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)

[Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)

Adversaries may rent Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that can be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/004)

[Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/004)

Adversaries may buy, lease, rent, or obtain physical servers that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, such as watering hole operations in [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), enabling [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) operations, or facilitating [Command and Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011). Instead of compromising a third-party [Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004) or renting a [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003), adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations. Free trial periods of cloud servers may also be abused.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/005)

[Botnet](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/005)

Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006)

[Web Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006)

Adversaries may register for web services that can be used during targeting. A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. By utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007)

[Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007)

Adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008)

[Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008)

Adversaries may purchase online advertisements that can be abused to distribute malware to victims. Ads can be purchased to plant as well as favorably position artifacts in specific locations online, such as prominently placed within search engine results. These ads may make it more difficult for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements. Purchased ads may also target specific audiences using the advertising network�s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage of the trust inherently given to search engines and popular websites.

[T1595](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595)

[Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595)

Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting. Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/001)

[Scanning IP Blocks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/001)

Adversaries may scan victim IP blocks to gather information that can be used during targeting. Public IP addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/002)

[Vulnerability Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/002)

Adversaries may scan victims for vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. Vulnerability scans typically check if the configuration of a target host/application (ex: software and version) potentially aligns with the target of a specific exploit the adversary may seek to use.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/003)

[Wordlist Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/003)

Adversaries may iteratively probe infrastructure using brute-forcing and crawling techniques. While this technique employs similar methods to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials. Wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and file extensions or terms specific to a particular software. Adversaries may also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other Reconnaissance techniques (ex: [Gather Victim Org Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1591), or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)).

[T1557](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)

Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001)

[LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001)

By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002)

[ARP Cache Poisoning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002)

Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003)

[DHCP Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003)

Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

[T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)

[Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)

Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)

[Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/002)

[File Transfer Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/002)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with transferring files to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/003)

[Mail Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/003)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with electronic mail delivery to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004)

[DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004)

Adversaries may communicate using the Domain Name System (DNS) application layer protocol to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[T1010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1010)

[Application Window Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1010)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of open application windows. Window listings could convey information about how the system is used. For example, information about application windows could be used identify potential data to collect as well as identifying security tooling ([Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001)) to evade.

[T1560](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560)

[Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560)

An adversary may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration. Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the amount of data sent over the network. Encryption can be used to hide information that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/001)

[Archive via Utility](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/001)

Adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration. Many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/002)

[Archive via Library](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/002)

An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using 3rd party libraries. Many libraries exist that can archive data, including [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006) rarfile , libzip , and zlib . Most libraries include functionality to encrypt and/or compress data.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/003)

[Archive via Custom Method](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/003)

An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using a custom method. Adversaries may choose to use custom archival methods, such as encryption with XOR or stream ciphers implemented with no external library or utility references. Custom implementations of well-known compression algorithms have also been used.

[T1123](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1123)

[Audio Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1123)

An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., microphones and webcams) or applications (e.g., voice and video call services) to capture audio recordings for the purpose of listening into sensitive conversations to gather information.

[T1119](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119)

[Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119)

Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals.

[T1020](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020)

[Automated Exfiltration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data, such as sensitive documents, through the use of automated processing after being gathered during Collection.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/001)

[Traffic Duplication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/001)

Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised infrastructure. Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, often used for network analysis. For example, devices may be configured to forward network traffic to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.

[T1197](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1197)

[BITS Jobs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1197)

Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM). BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

[T1547](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547)

[Boot or Logon Autostart Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547)

Adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems. Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon. These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)

[Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)

Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/002)

[Authentication Package](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/002)

Adversaries may abuse authentication packages to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows authentication package DLLs are loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. They provide support for multiple logon processes and multiple security protocols to the operating system.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/003)

[Time Providers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/003)

Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains. W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/004)

[Winlogon Helper DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/004)

Adversaries may abuse features of Winlogon to execute DLLs and/or executables when a user logs in. Winlogon.exe is a Windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete. Registry entries in HKLM\\Software\[\\Wow6432Node\\\]\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\ and HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\ are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/005)

[Security Support Provider](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/005)

Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006)

[Kernel Modules and Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006)

Adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system. 

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)

[Re-opened Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)

Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to "Reopen windows when logging back in". When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named com.apple.loginwindow.\[UUID\].plist within the ~/Library/Preferences/ByHost directory. Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user�s next logon.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/008)

[LSASS Driver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/008)

Adversaries may modify or add LSASS drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems. The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009)

[Shortcut Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009)

Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010)

[Port Monitors](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010)

Adversaries may use port monitors to run an adversary supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation. A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup. This DLL can be located in C:\\Windows\\System32 and will be loaded and run by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, under SYSTEM level permissions on boot.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/012)

[Print Processors](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/012)

Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013)

[XDG Autostart Entries](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013)

Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user�s desktop environment is loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files (.desktop) to configure the user�s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/014)

[Active Setup](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/014)

Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/015)

[Login Items](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/015)

Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges. Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in. Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework. Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call SMLoginItemSetEnabled.

[T1037](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)

[Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)

Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence. Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

[Logon Script (Windows)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. This is done via adding a path to a script to the HKCU\\Environment\\UserInitMprLogonScript Registry key.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/002)

[Login Hook](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/002)

Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon. A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. The plist file is located in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file and can be modified using the defaults command-line utility. This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003)

[Network Logon Script](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003)

Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects. These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)

[RC Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)

Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system�s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005)

[Startup Items](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005)

Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.

[T1176](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176)

[Browser Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176)

Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems. Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.

[T1217](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217)

[Browser Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217)

Adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised environments. Data saved by browsers (such as bookmarks, accounts, and browsing history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking sites, relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.

[T1185](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1185)

[Browser Session Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1185)

Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.

[T1110](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)

[Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)

Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained. Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001)

[Password Guessing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001)

Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002)

[Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002)

Adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained. [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) can be used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002) is not an option. Further, adversaries may leverage [Data from Configuration Repository](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602) in order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003)

[Password Spraying](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003)

Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/004)

[Credential Stuffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/004)

Adversaries may use credentials obtained from breach dumps of unrelated accounts to gain access to target accounts through credential overlap. Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.

[T1612](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1612)

[Build Image on Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1612)

Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry. A remote build request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.

[T1115](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115)

[Clipboard Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115)

Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.

[T1651](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1651)

[Cloud Administration Command](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1651)

[T1580](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)

[Cloud Infrastructure Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)

An adversary may attempt to discover infrastructure and resources that are available within an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment. This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other services including the storage and database services.

[T1538](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538)

[Cloud Service Dashboard](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538)

An adversary may use a cloud service dashboard GUI with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features. For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.

[T1526](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1526)

[Cloud Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1526)

An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access. These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service (PaaS), to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or software-as-a-service (SaaS). Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc. They may also include security services, such as AWS GuardDuty and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and Google Cloud Audit Logs.

[T1619](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619)

[Cloud Storage Object Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619)

Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure. Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage. Similar to [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) on a local host, after identifying available storage services (i.e. [Cloud Infrastructure Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)) adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure.

[T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)

[Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)

Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004) while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)

[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)

Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the Start-Process cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the Invoke-Command cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002)

[AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002)

Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution. AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents. These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript. These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003)

[Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003)

Adversaries may abuse the Windows command shell for execution. The Windows command shell ([cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106)) is the primary command prompt on Windows systems. The Windows command prompt can be used to control almost any aspect of a system, with various permission levels required for different subsets of commands. The command prompt can be invoked remotely via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)

[Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)

Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution. Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005)

[Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005)

Adversaries may abuse Visual Basic (VB) for execution. VB is a programming language created by Microsoft with interoperability with many Windows technologies such as [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) and the [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) through the Windows API. Although tagged as legacy with no planned future evolutions, VB is integrated and supported in the .NET Framework and cross-platform .NET Core.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006)

[Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006)

Adversaries may abuse Python commands and scripts for execution. Python is a very popular scripting/programming language, with capabilities to perform many functions. Python can be executed interactively from the command-line (via the python.exe interpreter) or via scripts (.py) that can be written and distributed to different systems. Python code can also be compiled into binary executables.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007)

[JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007)

Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript for execution. JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language (compiled just-in-time at runtime) commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though JS can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)

[Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)

Adversaries may abuse scripting or built-in command line interpreters (CLI) on network devices to execute malicious command and payloads. The CLI is the primary means through which users and administrators interact with the device in order to view system information, modify device operations, or perform diagnostic and administrative functions. CLIs typically contain various permission levels required for different commands.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)

[Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)

Adversaries may abuse cloud APIs to execute malicious commands. APIs available in cloud environments provide various functionalities and are a feature-rich method for programmatic access to nearly all aspects of a tenant. These APIs may be utilized through various methods such as command line interpreters (CLIs), in-browser Cloud Shells, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) modules like Azure for PowerShell, or software developer kits (SDKs) available for languages such as [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006).

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/010)

[AutoHotKey & AutoIT](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/010)

These automation scripts can be used to perform a wide variety of actions, such as clicking on buttons, entering text, and opening and closing programs.

[T1092](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1092)

[Communication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1092)

Adversaries can perform command and control between compromised hosts on potentially disconnected networks using removable media to transfer commands from system to system. Both systems would need to be compromised, with the likelihood that an Internet-connected system was compromised first and the second through lateral movement by [Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091). Commands and files would be relayed from the disconnected system to the Internet-connected system to which the adversary has direct access.

[T1586](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)

[Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)

Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating accounts (i.e. [Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585)), adversaries may compromise existing accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/001)

[Social Media Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/001)

Adversaries may compromise social media accounts that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating social media profiles (i.e. [Social Media Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/001)), adversaries may compromise existing social media accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/002)

[Email Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/002)

Adversaries can use compromised email accounts to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), or large-scale spam email campaigns. Utilizing an existing persona with a compromised email account may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship with, or knowledge of, the compromised persona. Compromised email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex: [Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/003)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/003)

Adversaries may compromise cloud accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use compromised cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets for [Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002) or to [Upload Tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/002)s. Cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such as [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)s or [Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007) infrastructure. Compromising cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.

[T1554](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1554)

[Compromise Host Software Binary](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1554)

Adversaries may modify host software binaries to establish persistent access to systems. Software binaries/executables provide a wide range of system commands or services, programs, and libraries. Common software binaries are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, web browsers, and many other user or server applications.

[T1584](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)

[Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)

Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, network devices, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle. Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/001)

[Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/001)

Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting. Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant. Adversaries may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain. The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration. Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account or taking advantage of renewal process gaps.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/002)

[DNS Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/002)

Adversaries may compromise third-party DNS servers that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: [Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)). Instead of setting up their own DNS servers, adversaries may compromise third-party DNS servers in support of operations.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/003)

[Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/003)

Adversaries may compromise third-party Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) that can be used during targeting. There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. Adversaries may compromise VPSs purchased by third-party entities. By compromising a VPS to use as infrastructure, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to themselves.

[Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004)

Adversaries may compromise third-party servers that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, including for Command and Control. Instead of purchasing a [Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/004) or [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003), adversaries may compromise third-party servers in support of operations.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/005)

[Botnet](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/005)

Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems. Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/006)

[Web Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/006)

Adversaries may compromise access to third-party web services that can be used during targeting. A variety of popular websites exist for legitimate users to register for web-based services, such as GitHub, Twitter, Dropbox, Google, SendGrid, etc. Adversaries may try to take ownership of a legitimate user's access to a web service and use that web service as infrastructure in support of cyber operations. Such web services can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. By utilizing a web service, particularly when access is stolen from legitimate users, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. Additionally, leveraging compromised web-based email services may allow adversaries to leverage the trust associated with legitimate domains.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/007)

[Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/007)

Adversaries may compromise serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/008)

[Network Devices](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/008)

Adversaries may compromise third-party network devices that can be used during targeting. Network devices, such as small office/home office (SOHO) routers, may be compromised where the adversary's ultimate goal is not [Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0001) to that environment -- instead leveraging these devices to support additional targeting.

[T1609](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1609)

[Container Administration Command](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1609)

Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within a container. A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers within an environment.

[T1613](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1613)

[Container and Resource Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1613)

Adversaries may attempt to discover containers and other resources that are available within a containers environment. Other resources may include images, deployments, pods, nodes, and other information such as the status of a cluster.

[T1659](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1659)

[Content Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1659)

Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004) followed by [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)), adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) and other data to already compromised systems.

[T1136](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)

[Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)

Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/001)

[Local Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/001)

Adversaries may create a local account to maintain access to victim systems. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/002)

[Domain Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/002)

Adversaries may create a domain account to maintain access to victim systems. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover user, administrator, and service accounts. With a sufficient level of access, the net user /add /domain command can be used to create a domain account.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/003)

[Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/003)

Adversaries may create a cloud account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

[T1543](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)

[Create or Modify System Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)

Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services. On macOS, launchd processes known as [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) and [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001) are run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)

[Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)

Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) file found in /System/Library/LaunchAgents, /Library/LaunchAgents, and ~/Library/LaunchAgents. Property list files use the Label, ProgramArguments , and RunAtLoad keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time. Launch Agents are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002)

[Systemd Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002)

Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Systemd is a system and service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources. Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)

[Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)

Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions. Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)

[Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)

Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ and /Library/LaunchDaemons/. Required Launch Daemons parameters include a Label to identify the task, Program to provide a path to the executable, and RunAtLoad to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/005)

[Container Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/005)

Adversaries may create or modify container or container cluster management tools that run as daemons, agents, or services on individual hosts. These include software for creating and managing individual containers, such as Docker and Podman, as well as container cluster node-level agents such as kubelet. By modifying these services, an adversary may be able to achieve persistence or escalate their privileges on a host.

[T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555)

[Credentials from Password Stores](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555)

Adversaries may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials. Passwords are stored in several places on a system, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials. There are also specific applications and services that store passwords to make them easier for users to manage and maintain, such as password managers and cloud secrets vaults. Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/001)

[Keychain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/001)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from Keychain. Keychain (or Keychain Services) is the macOS credential management system that stores account names, passwords, private keys, certificates, sensitive application data, payment data, and secure notes. There are three types of Keychains: Login Keychain, System Keychain, and Local Items (iCloud) Keychain. The default Keychain is the Login Keychain, which stores user passwords and information. The System Keychain stores items accessed by the operating system, such as items shared among users on a host. The Local Items (iCloud) Keychain is used for items synced with Apple�s iCloud service.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/002)

[Securityd Memory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/002)

An adversary with root access may gather credentials by reading securityd�s memory. securityd is a service/daemon responsible for implementing security protocols such as encryption and authorization. A privileged adversary may be able to scan through securityd's memory to find the correct sequence of keys to decrypt the user�s logon keychain. This may provide the adversary with various plaintext passwords, such as those for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003)

[Credentials from Web Browsers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser. Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future. Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/004)

[Windows Credential Manager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/004)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/005)

[Password Managers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/005)

Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers. Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/006)

[Cloud Secrets Management Stores](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/006)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from cloud-native secret management solutions such as AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Terraform Vault.

[T1485](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485)

[Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485)

Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives. Common operating system file deletion commands such as del and rm often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.

[T1132](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132)

[Data Encoding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132)

Adversaries may encode data to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system. Use of data encoding may adhere to existing protocol specifications and includes use of ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, or other binary-to-text and character encoding systems. Some data encoding systems may also result in data compression, such as gzip.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/001)

[Standard Encoding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/001)

Adversaries may encode data with a standard data encoding system to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system that adheres to existing protocol specifications. Common data encoding schemes include ASCII, Unicode, hexadecimal, Base64, and MIME. Some data encoding systems may also result in data compression, such as gzip.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/002)

[Non-Standard Encoding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/002)

Adversaries may encode data with a non-standard data encoding system to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a non-standard data encoding system that diverges from existing protocol specifications. Non-standard data encoding schemes may be based on or related to standard data encoding schemes, such as a modified Base64 encoding for the message body of an HTTP request.

[T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)

[Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)

Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.

[T1530](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530)

[Data from Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530)

Adversaries may access data from cloud storage.

[T1602](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602)

[Data from Configuration Repository](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602)

Adversaries may collect data related to managed devices from configuration repositories. Configuration repositories are used by management systems in order to configure, manage, and control data on remote systems. Configuration repositories may also facilitate remote access and administration of devices.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/001)

[SNMP (MIB Dump)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/001)

Adversaries may target the Management Information Base (MIB) to collect and/or mine valuable information in a network managed using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/002)

[Network Device Configuration Dump](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/002)

Adversaries may access network configuration files to collect sensitive data about the device and the network. The network configuration is a file containing parameters that determine the operation of the device. The device typically stores an in-memory copy of the configuration while operating, and a separate configuration on non-volatile storage to load after device reset. Adversaries can inspect the configuration files to reveal information about the target network and its layout, the network device and its software, or identifying legitimate accounts and credentials for later use.

[T1213](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213)

[Data from Information Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213)

Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/001)

[Confluence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/001)

Adversaries may leverage Confluence repositories to mine valuable information. Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation, however, in general may contain more diverse categories of useful information, such as:

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002)

[Sharepoint](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002)

Adversaries may leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable information. SharePoint will often contain useful information for an adversary to learn about the structure and functionality of the internal network and systems. For example, the following is a list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on SharePoint:

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/003)

[Code Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/003)

Adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information. Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds. They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket. Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git.

[T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005)

[Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005)

Adversaries may search local system sources, such as file systems and configuration files or local databases, to find files of interest and sensitive data prior to Exfiltration.

[T1039](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1039)

[Data from Network Shared Drive](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1039)

Adversaries may search network shares on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives (host shared directory, network file server, etc.) that are accessible from the current system prior to Exfiltration. Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) may be used to gather information.

[T1025](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)

[Data from Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)

Adversaries may search connected removable media on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from any removable media (optical disk drive, USB memory, etc.) connected to the compromised system prior to Exfiltration. Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) may be used to gather information.

[T1565](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565)

[Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565)

Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/001)

[Stored Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/001)

Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002)

[Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002)

Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/003)

[Runtime Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/003)

Adversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end user, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.

[T1001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001)

[Data Obfuscation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001)

Adversaries may obfuscate command and control traffic to make it more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) communications are hidden (but not necessarily encrypted) in an attempt to make the content more difficult to discover or decipher and to make the communication less conspicuous and hide commands from being seen. This encompasses many methods, such as adding junk data to protocol traffic, using steganography, or impersonating legitimate protocols.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/001)

[Junk Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/001)

Adversaries may add junk data to protocols used for command and control to make detection more difficult. By adding random or meaningless data to the protocols used for command and control, adversaries can prevent trivial methods for decoding, deciphering, or otherwise analyzing the traffic. Examples may include appending/prepending data with junk characters or writing junk characters between significant characters.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/002)

[Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/002)

Adversaries may use steganographic techniques to hide command and control traffic to make detection efforts more difficult. Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems. This hidden information can be used for command and control of compromised systems. In some cases, the passing of files embedded using steganography, such as image or document files, can be used for command and control.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/003)

[Protocol Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/003)

Adversaries may impersonate legitimate protocols or web service traffic to disguise command and control activity and thwart analysis efforts. By impersonating legitimate protocols or web services, adversaries can make their command and control traffic blend in with legitimate network traffic.

[T1074](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074)

[Data Staged](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074)

Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)

[Local Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)

Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory on the local system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002)

[Remote Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002)

Adversaries may stage data collected from multiple systems in a central location or directory on one system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

[T1030](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1030)

[Data Transfer Size Limits](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1030)

An adversary may exfiltrate data in fixed size chunks instead of whole files or limit packet sizes below certain thresholds. This approach may be used to avoid triggering network data transfer threshold alerts.

[T1622](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1622)

[Debugger Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1622)

Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid debuggers. Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.

[T1491](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491)

[Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491)

Adversaries may modify visual content available internally or externally to an enterprise network, thus affecting the integrity of the original content. Reasons for [Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491) include delivering messaging, intimidation, or claiming (possibly false) credit for an intrusion. Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of [Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491) in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001)

[Internal Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001)

An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thus discrediting the integrity of the systems. This may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper. Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of [Internal Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001) in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages. Since internally defacing systems exposes an adversary's presence, it often takes place after other intrusion goals have been accomplished.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002)

[External Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002)

An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users. [External Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002) may ultimately cause users to distrust the systems and to question/discredit the system�s integrity. Externally-facing websites are a common victim of defacement; often targeted by adversary and hacktivist groups in order to push a political message or spread propaganda. [External Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002) may be used as a catalyst to trigger events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government. Similarly, website defacement may also be used as setup, or a precursor, for future attacks such as [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).

[T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)

[Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)

Adversaries may use [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.

[T1610](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)

[Deploy Container](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)

Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment. In Kubernetes environments, an adversary may attempt to deploy a privileged or vulnerable container into a specific node in order to [Escape to Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611) and access other containers running on the node.

[T1587](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587)

[Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587)

Adversaries may build capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing capabilities, adversaries may develop their own capabilities in-house. This is the process of identifying development requirements and building solutions such as malware, exploits, and self-signed certificates. Adversaries may develop capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/001)

[Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/001)

Adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used during targeting. Building malicious software can include the development of payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors (including backdoored images), packers, C2 protocols, and the creation of infected removable media. Adversaries may develop malware to support their operations, creating a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/002)

[Code Signing Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/002)

Adversaries may create self-signed code signing certificates that can be used during targeting. Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/003)

[Digital Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/003)

Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner. In the case of self-signing, digital certificates will lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority (CA).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/004)

[Exploits](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/004)

Adversaries may develop exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. Rather than finding/modifying exploits from online or purchasing them from exploit vendors, an adversary may develop their own exploits. Adversaries may use information acquired via [Vulnerabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/006) to focus exploit development efforts. As part of the exploit development process, adversaries may uncover exploitable vulnerabilities through methods such as fuzzing and patch analysis.

[T1652](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1652)

[Device Driver Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1652)

Adversaries may attempt to enumerate local device drivers on a victim host. Information about device drivers may highlight various insights that shape follow-on behaviors, such as the function/purpose of the host, present security tools (i.e. [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001)) or other defenses (e.g., [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)), as well as potential exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)).

[T1006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1006)

[Direct Volume Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1006)

Adversaries may directly access a volume to bypass file access controls and file system monitoring. Windows allows programs to have direct access to logical volumes. Programs with direct access may read and write files directly from the drive by analyzing file system data structures. This technique may bypass Windows file access controls as well as file system monitoring tools.

[T1561](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561)

[Disk Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561)

Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data. Adversaries may opt to wipe arbitrary portions of disk data and/or wipe disk structures like the master boot record (MBR). A complete wipe of all disk sectors may be attempted.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001)

[Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001)

Adversaries may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002)

[Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002)

Adversaries may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.

[T1484](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)

[Domain or Tenant Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)

Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain or identity tenant to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in centrally managed environments. Such services provide a centralized means of managing identity resources such as devices and accounts, and often include configuration settings that may apply between domains or tenants such as trust relationships, identity syncing, or identity federation.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/001)

[Group Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/001)

Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the intention of escalating privileges on the domain. Group policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD). GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predictable network path \\<DOMAIN>\\SYSVOL\\<DOMAIN>\\Policies\\.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002)

[Trust Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002)

Adversaries may add new domain trusts, modify the properties of existing domain trusts, or otherwise change the configuration of trust relationships between domains and tenants to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges.Trust details, such as whether or not user identities are federated, allow authentication and authorization properties to apply between domains or tenants for the purpose of accessing shared resources. These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication material applied to servers, tokens, and domains.

[T1482](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482)

[Domain Trust Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1482)

Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships that may be used to identify lateral movement opportunities in Windows multi-domain/forest environments. Domain trusts provide a mechanism for a domain to allow access to resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain. Domain trusts allow the users of the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain. The information discovered may help the adversary conduct [SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005), [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003), and [Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003). Domain trusts can be enumerated using the DSEnumerateDomainTrusts() Win32 API call, .NET methods, and LDAP. The Windows utility [Nltest](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0359) is known to be used by adversaries to enumerate domain trusts.

[T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)

[Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)

Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).

[T1568](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568)

[Dynamic Resolution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568)

Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/001)

[Fast Flux DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/001)

Adversaries may use Fast Flux DNS to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing IP addresses linked to a single domain resolution. This technique uses a fully qualified domain name, with multiple IP addresses assigned to it which are swapped with high frequency, using a combination of round robin IP addressing and short Time-To-Live (TTL) for a DNS resource record.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002)

[Domain Generation Algorithms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002)

Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/003)

[DNS Calculation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/003)

Adversaries may perform calculations on addresses returned in DNS results to determine which port and IP address to use for command and control, rather than relying on a predetermined port number or the actual returned IP address. A IP and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a C2 channel.

[T1114](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114)

[Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114)

Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information. Emails may contain sensitive data, including trade secrets or personal information, that can prove valuable to adversaries. Adversaries can collect or forward email from mail servers or clients.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/001)

[Local Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/001)

Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information. Files containing email data can be acquired from a user�s local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/002)

[Remote Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/002)

Adversaries may target an Exchange server, Office 365, or Google Workspace to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may leverage a user's credentials and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within a network. Adversaries may also access externally facing Exchange services, Office 365, or Google Workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens. Tools such as [MailSniper](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0413) can be used to automate searches for specific keywords.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003)

[Email Forwarding Rule](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003)

Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim�s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations. Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators. Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.

[T1573](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573)

[Encrypted Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573)

Adversaries may employ an encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001)

[Symmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001)

Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, and RC4.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002)

[Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002)

Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver�s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.

[T1499](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499)

[Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499)

Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/001)

[OS Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/001)

Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS). A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)

[Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)

Adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (DoS). Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well. Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/003)

[Application Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/003)

Adversaries may target resource intensive features of applications to cause a denial of service (DoS), denying availability to those applications. For example, specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive. Repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust system resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)

[Application or System Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users. Some systems may automatically restart critical applications and services when crashes occur, but they can likely be re-exploited to cause a persistent denial of service (DoS) condition.

[T1611](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611)

[Escape to Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611)

Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host. This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself. In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.

[T1585](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585)

[Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585)

Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations. Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations. This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/001)

[Social Media Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/001)

Adversaries may create and cultivate social media accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can create social media accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations. Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/002)

[Email Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/002)

Adversaries may create email accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use accounts created with email providers to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598) or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Establishing email accounts may also allow adversaries to abuse free services � such as trial periods � to [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) for follow-on purposes.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/003)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/003)

Adversaries may create accounts with cloud providers that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, MEGA, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets for [Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002) or to [Upload Tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/002)s. Cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such as [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)s or [Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007) infrastructure. Establishing cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.

[T1546](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)

[Event Triggered Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. Cloud environments may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001)

[Change Default File Association](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association. When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility. Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/002)

[Screensaver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/002)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension. The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in C:\\Windows\\System32\\, and C:\\Windows\\sysWOW64\\ on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/003)

[Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/003)

Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription. WMI can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user login, or the computer's uptime.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004)

[Unix Shell Configuration Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004)

Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user�s shell. User [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user�s home directory (~/) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user�s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005)

[Trap](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal. The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/006)

[LC\_LOAD\_DYLIB Addition](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/006)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries. Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. The LC\_LOAD\_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies. There are tools available to perform these changes.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/007)

[Netsh Helper DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/007)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility. The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Netsh.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008)

[Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/009)

[AppCert DLLs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/009)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the AppCertDLLs Registry key under HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\ are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface (API) functions CreateProcess, CreateProcessAsUser, CreateProcessWithLoginW, CreateProcessWithTokenW, or WinExec.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/010)

[AppInit DLLs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/010)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the AppInit\_DLLs value in the Registry keys HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows or HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads user32.dll. In practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/011)

[Application Shimming](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/011)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims. The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)

[Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers. IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application�s IFEO will be prepended to the application�s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., C:\\dbg\\ntsd.exe -g notepad.exe).

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/013)

[PowerShell Profile](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/013)

Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles. A PowerShell profile (profile.ps1) is a script that runs when [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.

[Emond](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/014)

Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond). Emond is a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at /sbin/emond will load any rules from the /etc/emond.d/rules/ directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015)

[Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system. References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.

[.016](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/016)

[Installer Packages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/016)

Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.

[T1480](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480)

[Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480)

Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary�s campaign. Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/001)

[Environmental Keying](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/001)

Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment. Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Environmental keying is an implementation of [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480) that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.

The physical medium or device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1052/001)

[Exfiltration over USB](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1052/001)

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a USB connected physical device. In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a USB device introduced by a user. The USB device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.

[T1567](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567)

[Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/001)

[Exfiltration to Code Repository](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/001)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel. Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com). Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002)

[Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002)

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/004)

[Exfiltration Over Webhook](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/004)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a webhook endpoint rather than over their primary command and control channel. Webhooks are simple mechanisms for allowing a server to push data over HTTP/S to a client without the need for the client to continuously poll the server. Many public and commercial services, such as Discord, Slack, and webhook.site, support the creation of webhook endpoints that can be used by other services, such as Github, Jira, or Trello. When changes happen in the linked services (such as pushing a repository update or modifying a ticket), these services will automatically post the data to the webhook endpoint for use by the consuming application.

[T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190)

[Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190)

Adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially access a network. The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration.

Adversaries may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from the plain sight of users. In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004)

[NTFS File Attributes](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004)

Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection. Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition. Within MFT entries are file attributes, such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data \[known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) when more than one Data attribute is present\], that can be used to store arbitrary data (and even complete files).

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/005)

[Hidden File System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/005)

Adversaries may use a hidden file system to conceal malicious activity from users and security tools. File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage. Typically, a user engages with a file system through applications that allow them to access files and directories, which are an abstraction from their physical location (ex: disk sector). Standard file systems include FAT, NTFS, ext4, and APFS. File systems can also contain other structures, such as the Volume Boot Record (VBR) and Master File Table (MFT) in NTFS.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/006)

[Run Virtual Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/006)

Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance. Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/007)

[VBA Stomping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/007)

Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/008)

[Email Hiding Rules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/008)

Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox. Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails. Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the New-InboxRule or Set-InboxRule [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) cmdlets on Windows systems.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/009)

[Resource Forking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/009)

Adversaries may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications. A resource fork provides applications a structured way to store resources such as thumbnail images, menu definitions, icons, dialog boxes, and code. Usage of a resource fork is identifiable when displaying a file�s extended attributes, using ls -l@ or xattr -l commands. Resource forks have been deprecated and replaced with the application bundle structure. Non-localized resources are placed at the top level directory of an application bundle, while localized resources are placed in the /Resources folder.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/010)

[Process Argument Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/010)

Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory. Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process. The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process. When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/011)

[Ignore Process Interrupts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/011)

Adversaries may evade defensive mechanisms by executing commands that hide from process interrupt signals. Many operating systems use signals to deliver messages to control process behavior. Command interpreters often include specific commands/flags that ignore errors and other hangups, such as when the user of the active session logs off. These interrupt signals may also be used by defensive tools and/or analysts to pause or terminate specified running processes.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/012)

[File/Path Exclusions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/012)

Adversaries may attempt to hide their file-based artifacts by writing them to specific folders or file names excluded from antivirus (AV) scanning and other defensive capabilities. AV and other file-based scanners often include exclusions to optimize performance as well as ease installation and legitimate use of applications. These exclusions may be contextual (e.g., scans are only initiated in response to specific triggering events/alerts), but are also often hardcoded strings referencing specific folders and/or files assumed to be trusted and legitimate.

[T1665](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1665)

[Hide Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1665)

Adversaries may manipulate network traffic in order to hide and evade detection of their C2 infrastructure. This can be accomplished in various ways including by identifying and filtering traffic from defensive tools, masking malicious domains to obfuscate the true destination from both automated scanning tools and security researchers, and otherwise hiding malicious artifacts to delay discovery and prolong the effectiveness of adversary infrastructure that could otherwise be identified, blocked, or taken down entirely.

[T1574](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

[Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

[DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

[DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

[Dylib Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with @rpath, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable. Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the LC\_LOAD\_WEAK\_DYLIB function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

[Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

[Dynamic Linker Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD\_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD\_INSERT\_LIBRARIES on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

[Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

[Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

[Path Interception by Unquoted Path](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

[Services File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

[Services Registry Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

[COR\_PROFILER](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

Adversaries may leverage the COR\_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR\_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

[KernelCallbackTable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

Adversaries may abuse the KernelCallbackTable of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads. The KernelCallbackTable can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once user32.dll is loaded.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

[AppDomainManager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking how the .NET AppDomainManager loads assemblies. The .NET framework uses the AppDomainManager class to create and manage one or more isolated runtime environments (called application domains) inside a process to host the execution of .NET applications. Assemblies (.exe or .dll binaries compiled to run as .NET code) may be loaded into an application domain as executable code.

[T1562](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562)

[Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562)

Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)

[Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)

Adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their malware/tools and activities. This may take many forms, such as killing security software processes or services, modifying / deleting Registry keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate properly, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. Adversaries may also disable updates to prevent the latest security patches from reaching tools on victim systems.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/002)

[Disable Windows Event Logging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/002)

Adversaries may disable Windows event logging to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits. Windows event logs record user and system activity such as login attempts, process creation, and much more. This data is used by security tools and analysts to generate detections.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/003)

[Impair Command History Logging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/003)

Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004)

[Disable or Modify System Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004)

Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006)

[Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006)

An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. This could include maliciously redirecting or even disabling host-based sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry. These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) or [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047).

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/007)

[Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/007)

Adversaries may disable or modify a firewall within a cloud environment to bypass controls that limit access to cloud resources. Cloud firewalls are separate from system firewalls that are described in [Disable or Modify System Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004).

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008)

[Disable or Modify Cloud Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008)

An adversary may disable or modify cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or modify logging to avoid detection of their activities.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/009)

[Safe Mode Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/009)

Adversaries may abuse Windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses. Safe mode starts up the Windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services. Third-party security software such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools may not start after booting Windows in safe mode. There are two versions of safe mode: Safe Mode and Safe Mode with Networking. It is possible to start additional services after a safe mode boot.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)

[Downgrade Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)

Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls. Downgrade attacks typically take advantage of a system�s backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/011)

[Spoof Security Alerting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/011)

Adversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defenders� awareness of malicious activity. Messages produced by defensive tools contain information about potential security events as well as the functioning status of security software and the system. Security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a security incident.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/012)

[Disable or Modify Linux Audit System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/012)

Adversaries may disable or modify the Linux audit system to hide malicious activity and avoid detection. Linux admins use the Linux Audit system to track security-relevant information on a system. The Linux Audit system operates at the kernel-level and maintains event logs on application and system activity such as process, network, file, and login events based on pre-configured rules.

[T1656](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)

[Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)

Adversaries may impersonate a trusted person or organization in order to persuade and trick a target into performing some action on their behalf. For example, adversaries may communicate with victims (via [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), or [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)) while impersonating a known sender such as an executive, colleague, or third-party vendor. Established trust can then be leveraged to accomplish an adversary�s ultimate goals, possibly against multiple victims.

[T1525](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1525)

[Implant Internal Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1525)

Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored. Unlike [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001), this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim�s environment. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.

[T1070](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070)

[Indicator Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070)

Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary�s actions. Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001)

[Clear Windows Event Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001)

Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. There are three system-defined sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with five event types: Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/002)

[Clear Linux or Mac System Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/002)

Adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macOS and Linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs. The majority of native system logging is stored under the /var/log/ directory. Subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions, such as:

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/003)

[Clear Command History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/003)

In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004)

[File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004)

Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity. Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary (ex: [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how. Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/005)

[Network Share Connection Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/005)

Adversaries may remove share connections that are no longer useful in order to clean up traces of their operation. Windows shared drive and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) connections can be removed when no longer needed. [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) is an example utility that can be used to remove network share connections with the net use \\system\\share /delete command.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006)

[Timestomp](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006)

Adversaries may modify file time attributes to hide new or changes to existing files. Timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder. This is done, for example, on files that have been modified or created by the adversary so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/007)

[Clear Network Connection History and Configurations](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/007)

Adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections in order to clean up traces of their operations. Configuration settings as well as various artifacts that highlight connection history may be created on a system and/or in application logs from behaviors that require network connections, such as [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) or [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133). Defenders may use these artifacts to monitor or otherwise analyze network connections created by adversaries.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/008)

[Clear Mailbox Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/008)

Adversaries may modify mail and mail application data to remove evidence of their activity. Email applications allow users and other programs to export and delete mailbox data via command line tools or use of APIs. Mail application data can be emails, email metadata, or logs generated by the application or operating system, such as export requests.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/009)

[Clear Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/009)

Adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity. This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112), [Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647), or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence. Adversaries may also delete accounts previously created to maintain persistence (i.e. [Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)).

[T1202](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202)

[Indirect Command Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202)

Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106). For example, [Forfiles](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0193), the Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), Run window, or via scripts.

[T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)

[Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as [ftp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095). Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)).

[T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490)

[Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490)

Adversaries may delete or remove built-in data and turn off services designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted system to prevent recovery. This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.

[T1056](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)

[Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)

Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. [Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001)

[Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001)

Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them. Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured. In order to increase the likelihood of capturing credentials quickly, an adversary may also perform actions such as clearing browser cookies to force users to reauthenticate to systems.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/002)

[GUI Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/002)

Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)

[Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)

Adversaries may install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. For example, a compromised login page may log provided user credentials before logging the user in to the service.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)

[Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)

Adversaries may hook into Windows application programming interface (API) functions to collect user credentials. Malicious hooking mechanisms may capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials. Unlike [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001), this technique focuses specifically on API functions that include parameters that reveal user credentials. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:

[T1559](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559)

[Inter-Process Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559)

Adversaries may abuse inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms for local code or command execution. IPC is typically used by processes to share data, communicate with each other, or synchronize execution. IPC is also commonly used to avoid situations such as deadlocks, which occurs when processes are stuck in a cyclic waiting pattern.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001)

[Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001)

Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model (COM) for local code execution. COM is an inter-process communication (IPC) component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces. Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically binary Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE). Remote COM execution is facilitated by [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) (DCOM).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002)

[Dynamic Data Exchange](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002)

Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/003)

[XPC Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/003)

Adversaries can provide malicious content to an XPC service daemon for local code execution. macOS uses XPC services for basic inter-process communication between various processes, such as between the XPC Service daemon and third-party application privileged helper tools. Applications can send messages to the XPC Service daemon, which runs as root, using the low-level XPC Service C API or the high level NSXPCConnection API in order to handle tasks that require elevated privileges (such as network connections). Applications are responsible for providing the protocol definition which serves as a blueprint of the XPC services. Developers typically use XPC Services to provide applications stability and privilege separation between the application client and the daemon.

[T1534](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)

[Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)

After they already have access to accounts or systems within the environment, adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information or compromise other users within the same organization. Internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where a legitimate account is initially compromised either by controlling the user's device or by compromising the account credentials of the user. Adversaries may then attempt to take advantage of the trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking more victims into falling for phish attempts, often incorporating [Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656).

[T1570](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)

[Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. Once brought into the victim environment (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) files may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.

[T1654](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1654)

[Log Enumeration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1654)

Adversaries may enumerate system and service logs to find useful data. These logs may highlight various types of valuable insights for an adversary, such as user authentication records ([Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)), security or vulnerable software ([Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518)), or hosts within a compromised network ([Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018)).

[T1036](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)

[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)

Adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001)

[Invalid Code Signature](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001)

Adversaries may attempt to mimic features of valid code signatures to increase the chance of deceiving a user, analyst, or tool. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. Adversaries can copy the metadata and signature information from a signed program, then use it as a template for an unsigned program. Files with invalid code signatures will fail digital signature validation checks, but they may appear more legitimate to users and security tools may improperly handle these files.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/002)

[Right-to-Left Override](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/002)

Adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign. RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse. For example, a Windows screensaver executable named March 25 \\u202Excod.scr will display as March 25 rcs.docx. A JavaScript file named photo\_high\_re\\u202Egnp.js will be displayed as photo\_high\_resj.png.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003)

[Rename System Utilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003)

Adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities to try to evade security mechanisms concerning the usage of those utilities. Security monitoring and control mechanisms may be in place for system utilities adversaries are capable of abusing. It may be possible to bypass those security mechanisms by renaming the utility prior to utilization (ex: rename rundll32.exe). An alternative case occurs when a legitimate utility is copied or moved to a different directory and renamed to avoid detections based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004)

[Masquerade Task or Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004)

Adversaries may attempt to manipulate the name of a task or service to make it appear legitimate or benign. Tasks/services executed by the Task Scheduler or systemd will typically be given a name and/or description. Windows services will have a service name as well as a display name. Many benign tasks and services exist that have commonly associated names. Adversaries may give tasks or services names that are similar or identical to those of legitimate ones.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005)

[Match Legitimate Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005)

Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/006)

[Space after Filename](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/006)

Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file. With certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/007)

[Double File Extension](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/007)

Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type. A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed (ex: File.txt.exe may render in some views as just File.txt). However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed. The real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser (ex: explorer.exe), as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system�s policies.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/008)

[Masquerade File Type](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/008)

Adversaries may masquerade malicious payloads as legitimate files through changes to the payload's formatting, including the file�s signature, extension, and contents. Various file types have a typical standard format, including how they are encoded and organized. For example, a file�s signature (also known as header or magic bytes) is the beginning bytes of a file and is often used to identify the file�s type. For example, the header of a JPEG file, is 0xFF 0xD8 and the file extension is either .JPE, .JPEG or .JPG.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/009)

[Break Process Trees](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/009)

An adversary may attempt to evade process tree-based analysis by modifying executed malware's parent process ID (PPID). If endpoint protection software leverages the "parent-child" relationship for detection, breaking this relationship could result in the adversary�s behavior not being associated with previous process tree activity. On Unix-based systems breaking this process tree is common practice for administrators to execute software using scripts and programs.

[T1556](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

[Modify Authentication Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

[Domain Controller Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

[Password Filter DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

[Pluggable Authentication Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is pam\_unix.so, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

[Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

Adversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

[Reversible Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

Adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

[Hybrid Identity](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

[Network Provider DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

Adversaries may register malicious network provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to capture cleartext user credentials during the authentication process. Network provider DLLs allow Windows to interface with specific network protocols and can also support add-on credential management functions. During the logon process, Winlogon (the interactive logon module) sends credentials to the local mpnotify.exe process via RPC. The mpnotify.exe process then shares the credentials in cleartext with registered credential managers when notifying that a logon event is happening.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

[Conditional Access Policies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.

[T1578](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578)

[Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578)

An adversary may attempt to modify a cloud account's compute service infrastructure to evade defenses. A modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/001)

[Create Snapshot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/001)

An adversary may create a snapshot or data backup within a cloud account to evade defenses. A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (VM), virtual hard drive, or volume. An adversary may leverage permissions to create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike in [Revert Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004) where an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/002)

[Create Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/002)

An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine (VM) within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses. Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account. An adversary may [Create Snapshot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/001) of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect [Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005) or for [Remote Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/003)

[Delete Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/003)

An adversary may delete a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in an attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. Deleting an instance or virtual machine can remove valuable forensic artifacts and other evidence of suspicious behavior if the instance is not recoverable.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004)

[Revert Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004)

An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/005)

[Modify Cloud Compute Configurations](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/005)

Adversaries may modify settings that directly affect the size, locations, and resources available to cloud compute infrastructure in order to evade defenses. These settings may include service quotas, subscription associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available compute. Such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim�s compute resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution of running instances and/or revealing their activities to the victim.

[T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)

[Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)

Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution.

[T1601](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601)

[Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601)

Adversaries may make changes to the operating system of embedded network devices to weaken defenses and provide new capabilities for themselves. On such devices, the operating systems are typically monolithic and most of the device functionality and capabilities are contained within a single file.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)

[Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)

Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses. Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file. Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002)

[Downgrade System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002)

Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security. Older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features.

[T1111](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111)

[Multi-Factor Authentication Interception](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111)

Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, (i.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms.

[T1621](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621)

[Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621)

Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.

[T1104](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104)

[Multi-Stage Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104)

Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions. Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.

[T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)

[Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)

Adversaries may interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to execute behaviors. Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.

[T1599](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599)

[Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599)

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation. Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001)

[Network Address Translation Traversal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001)

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device�s Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration. Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.

[T1498](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498)

[Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498)

Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)

[Direct Network Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)

Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. [Direct Network Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)s are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. Almost any network protocol may be used for flooding. Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/002)

[Reflection Amplification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/002)

Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target. This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.

[T1046](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046)

[Network Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts and local network infrastructure devices, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Common methods to acquire this information include port and/or vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.

[T1135](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135)

[Network Share Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1135)

Adversaries may look for folders and drives shared on remote systems as a means of identifying sources of information to gather as a precursor for Collection and to identify potential systems of interest for Lateral Movement. Networks often contain shared network drives and folders that enable users to access file directories on various systems across a network.

[T1040](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040)

[Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040)

Adversaries may passively sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

[T1095](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095)

[Non-Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095)

Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols is extensive. Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).

[T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)

[Non-Standard Port](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)

Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088 or port 587 as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.

[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)

[Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)

Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/001)

[Binary Padding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/001)

Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware. This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002)

[Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002)

Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003)

[Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003)

Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information. Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/004)

[Compile After Delivery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/004)

Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code. Text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries. These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005)

[Indicator Removal from Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005)

Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed. They can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006)

[HTML Smuggling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006)

Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files. HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects. Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents. HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/007)

[Dynamic API Resolution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/007)

Adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve API functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. Malware commonly uses various [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions provided by the OS to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/008)

[Stripped Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/008)

Adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information. Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality. Symbols are often created by an operating system�s linker when executable payloads are compiled. Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009)

[Embedded Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009)

Adversaries may embed payloads within other files to conceal malicious content from defenses. Otherwise seemingly benign files (such as scripts and executables) may be abused to carry and obfuscate malicious payloads and content. In some cases, embedded payloads may also enable adversaries to [Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553) by not impacting execution controls such as digital signatures and notarization tickets.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/010)

[Command Obfuscation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/010)

Adversaries may obfuscate content during command execution to impede detection. Command-line obfuscation is a method of making strings and patterns within commands and scripts more difficult to signature and analyze. This type of obfuscation can be included within commands executed by delivered payloads (e.g., [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) and [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)) or interactively via [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/011)

[Fileless Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/011)

Adversaries may store data in "fileless" formats to conceal malicious activity from defenses. Fileless storage can be broadly defined as any format other than a file. Common examples of non-volatile fileless storage include the Windows Registry, event logs, or WMI repository.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/012)

[LNK Icon Smuggling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/012)

Adversaries may smuggle commands to download malicious payloads past content filters by hiding them within otherwise seemingly benign windows shortcut files. Windows shortcut files (.LNK) include many metadata fields, including an icon location field (also known as the IconEnvironmentDataBlock) designed to specify the path to an icon file that is to be displayed for the LNK file within a host directory.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013)

[Encrypted/Encoded File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013)

Adversaries may encrypt or encode files to obfuscate strings, bytes, and other specific patterns to impede detection. Encrypting and/or encoding file content aims to conceal malicious artifacts within a file used in an intrusion. Many other techniques, such as [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), [Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), and [Embedded Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009), share this same broad objective. Encrypting and/or encoding files could lead to a lapse in detection of static signatures, only for this malicious content to be revealed (i.e., [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)) at the time of execution/use.

[T1588](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)

[Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)

Adversaries may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house, adversaries may purchase, freely download, or steal them. Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software (including licenses), exploits, certificates, and information relating to vulnerabilities. Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/001)

[Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/001)

Adversaries may buy, steal, or download malware that can be used during targeting. Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, packers, and C2 protocols. Adversaries may acquire malware to support their operations, obtaining a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/002)

[Tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/002)

Adversaries may buy, steal, or download software tools that can be used during targeting. Tools can be open or closed source, free or commercial. A tool can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex: [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029)). Tool acquisition can involve the procurement of commercial software licenses, including for red teaming tools such as [Cobalt Strike](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0154). Commercial software may be obtained through purchase, stealing licenses (or licensed copies of the software), or cracking trial versions.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/003)

[Code Signing Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/003)

Adversaries may buy and/or steal code signing certificates that can be used during targeting. Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/004)

[Digital Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/004)

Adversaries may buy and/or steal SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/005)

[Exploits](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/005)

Adversaries may buy, steal, or download exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. Rather than developing their own exploits, an adversary may find/modify exploits from online or purchase them from exploit vendors.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/006)

[Vulnerabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/006)

Adversaries may acquire information about vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. A vulnerability is a weakness in computer hardware or software that can, potentially, be exploited by an adversary to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur. Adversaries may find vulnerability information by searching open databases or gaining access to closed vulnerability databases.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/007)

[Artificial Intelligence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/007)

Adversaries may obtain access to generative artificial intelligence tools, such as large language models (LLMs), to aid various techniques during targeting. These tools may be used to inform, bolster, and enable a variety of malicious tasks including conducting [Reconnaissance](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043), creating basic scripts, assisting social engineering, and even developing payloads.

[T1137](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137)

[Office Application Startup](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137)

Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups. Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/001)

[Office Template Macros](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/001)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Microsoft Office contains templates that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles. The base templates within the application are used each time an application starts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/002)

[Office Test](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/002)

Adversaries may abuse the Microsoft Office "Office Test" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system. An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started. This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications. This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/003)

[Outlook Forms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/003)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook forms to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook forms are used as templates for presentation and functionality in Outlook messages. Custom Outlook forms can be created that will execute code when a specifically crafted email is sent by an adversary utilizing the same custom Outlook form.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/004)

[Outlook Home Page](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/004)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders. This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented whenever a folder is opened. A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/005)

[Outlook Rules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/005)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email messages. A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific sender. Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/006)

[Add-ins](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/006)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office add-ins to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Office add-ins can be used to add functionality to Office programs. There are different types of add-ins that can be used by the various Office products; including Word/Excel add-in Libraries (WLL/XLL), VBA add-ins, Office Component Object Model (COM) add-ins, automation add-ins, VBA Editor (VBE), Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) add-ins, and Outlook add-ins.

[T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)

[OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)

Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password. Credentials can be obtained from OS caches, memory, or structures. Credentials can then be used to perform [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and access restricted information.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001)

[LSASS Memory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001)

Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) using [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002)

[Security Account Manager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002)

Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the net user command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003)

[NTDS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003)

Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights. By default, the NTDS file (NTDS.dit) is located in %SystemRoot%\\NTDS\\Ntds.dit of a domain controller.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/004)

[LSA Secrets](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/004)

Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts. LSA secrets are stored in the registry at HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Policy\\Secrets. LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/005)

[Cached Domain Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/005)

Adversaries may attempt to access cached domain credentials used to allow authentication to occur in the event a domain controller is unavailable.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006)

[DCSync](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006)

Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information by abusing a Windows Domain Controller's application programming interface (API) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique called DCSync.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/007)

[Proc Filesystem](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/007)

Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or /proc. The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux based systems managing virtual memory. For each process, the /proc/<PID>/maps file shows how memory is mapped within the process�s virtual address space. And /proc/<PID>/mem, exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the process�s virtual address space.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/008)

[/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/008)

Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking. Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow. By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user.

[T1201](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1201)

[Password Policy Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1201)

Adversaries may attempt to access detailed information about the password policy used within an enterprise network or cloud environment. Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).

[T1120](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120)

[Peripheral Device Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1120)

Adversaries may attempt to gather information about attached peripheral devices and components connected to a computer system. Peripheral devices could include auxiliary resources that support a variety of functionalities such as keyboards, printers, cameras, smart card readers, or removable storage. The information may be used to enhance their awareness of the system and network environment or may be used for further actions.

[T1069](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069)

[Permission Groups Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069)

Adversaries may attempt to discover group and permission settings. This information can help adversaries determine which user accounts and groups are available, the membership of users in particular groups, and which users and groups have elevated permissions.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/001)

[Local Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/001)

Adversaries may attempt to find local system groups and permission settings. The knowledge of local system permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group. Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as the users found within the local administrators group.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/002)

[Domain Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/002)

Adversaries may attempt to find domain-level groups and permission settings. The knowledge of domain-level permission groups can help adversaries determine which groups exist and which users belong to a particular group. Adversaries may use this information to determine which users have elevated permissions, such as domain administrators.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/003)

[Cloud Groups](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1069/003)

Adversaries may attempt to find cloud groups and permission settings. The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.

[T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)

[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)

Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)

[Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)

Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)

[Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)

Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003)

[Spearphishing via Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003)

Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing.

[T1647](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647)

[Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647)

Adversaries may modify property list files (plist files) to enable other malicious activity, while also potentially evading and bypassing system defenses. macOS applications use plist files, such as the info.plist file, to store properties and configuration settings that inform the operating system how to handle the application at runtime. Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD. Plist files can be saved in text or binary format.

[T1653](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1653)

[Power Settings](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1653)

Adversaries may impair a system's ability to hibernate, reboot, or shut down in order to extend access to infected machines. When a computer enters a dormant state, some or all software and hardware may cease to operate which can disrupt malicious activity.

[T1542](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542)

[Pre-OS Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542)

Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence on a system. During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup services are loaded before the operating system. These programs control flow of execution before the operating system takes control.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001)

[System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001)

Adversaries may modify system firmware to persist on systems.The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) are examples of system firmware that operate as the software interface between the operating system and hardware of a computer.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/002)

[Component Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/002)

Adversaries may modify component firmware to persist on systems. Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS. This technique may be similar to [System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001) but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/003)

[Bootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/003)

Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems. Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)

[ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)

[T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)

[Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)

Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet.

[T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090)

[Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090)

Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001)

[Internal Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001)

Adversaries may use an internal proxy to direct command and control traffic between two or more systems in a compromised environment. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use internal proxies to manage command and control communications inside a compromised environment, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between infected systems to avoid suspicion. Internal proxy connections may use common peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols, such as SMB, to better blend in with the environment.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/002)

[External Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/002)

Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003)

[Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003)

Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to disguise the source of malicious traffic. Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy. This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/004)

[Domain Fronting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/004)

Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS. Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, "domainless" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).

[T1012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012)

[Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012)

[T1018](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018)

[Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for Lateral Movement from the current system. Functionality could exist within remote access tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system could also be used such as [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097) or net view using [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).

[T1091](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)

[Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)

Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.

[T1496](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496)

[Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496)

Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application is started/restarted).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/002)

[Transport Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/002)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems. Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails. Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server. Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)

[Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)

Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to access the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/004)

[IIS Components](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/004)

Adversaries may install malicious components that run on Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers to establish persistence. IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers. For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests. Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions: Get{Extension/Filter}Version, Http{Extension/Filter}Proc, and (optionally) Terminate{Extension/Filter}. IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/005)

[T1608](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608)

[Stage Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608)

Adversaries may upload, install, or otherwise set up capabilities that can be used during targeting. To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed ([Develop Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587)) or obtained ([Obtain Capabilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588)) and stage them on infrastructure under their control. These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or was otherwise compromised by them ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)). Capabilities may also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin, or on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings that enable users to easily provision applications.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001)

[Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001)

Adversaries may upload malware to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting. Malicious software can include payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors, and a variety of other malicious content. Adversaries may upload malware to support their operations, such as making a payload available to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) by placing it on an Internet accessible web server.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/002)

[Upload Tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/002)

Adversaries may upload tools to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting. Tools can be open or closed source, free or commercial. Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex: [PsExec](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0029)). Adversaries may upload tools to support their operations, such as making a tool available to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) by placing it on an Internet accessible web server.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/003)

[Install Digital Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/003)

Adversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certificates are files that can be installed on servers to enable secure communications between systems. Digital certificates include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate securely with its owner. Certificates can be uploaded to a server, then the server can be configured to use the certificate to enable encrypted communication with it.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)

[Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)

Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing. Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189). In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001). Prior to [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site. Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or previously compromised ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)).

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/005)

[Link Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/005)

Adversaries may put in place resources that are referenced by a link that can be used during targeting. An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to divulge information (including credentials) or to gain execution, as in [Malicious Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001). Links can be used for spearphishing, such as sending an email accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser. Prior to a phish for information (as in [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598/003)) or a phish to gain initial access to a system (as in [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)), an adversary must set up the resources for a link target for the spearphishing link.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/006)

[SEO Poisoning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/006)

Search engines typically display results to users based on purchased ads as well as the site�s ranking/score/reputation calculated by their web crawlers and algorithms.

[T1528](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)

[Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)

Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.

[T1649](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1649)

[Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1649)

Adversaries may steal or forge certificates used for authentication to access remote systems or resources. Digital certificates are often used to sign and encrypt messages and/or files. Certificates are also used as authentication material. For example, Azure AD device certificates and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificates bind to an identity and can be used as credentials for domain accounts.

[T1558](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558)

[Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558)

Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003). Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments. In Kerberos environments, referred to as "realms", there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC). Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting. Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001)

[Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001)

Adversaries who have the KRBTGT account password hash may forge Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGT), also known as a golden ticket. Golden tickets enable adversaries to generate authentication material for any account in Active Directory.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002)

[Silver Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002)

Adversaries who have the password hash of a target service account (e.g. SharePoint, MSSQL) may forge Kerberos ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, also known as silver tickets. Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003)

[Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003)

Adversaries may abuse a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or sniff network traffic to obtain a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket that may be vulnerable to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/004)

[AS-REP Roasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/004)

Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by [Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002) Kerberos messages.

[T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)

[Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)

An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.

[T1553](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553)

[Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553)

Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs. Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/001)

[Gatekeeper Bypass](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/001)

Adversaries may modify file attributes and subvert Gatekeeper functionality to evade user prompts and execute untrusted programs. Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple�s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host. Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more. Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002)

[Code Signing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002)

Adversaries may create, acquire, or steal code signing materials to sign their malware or tools. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. The certificates used during an operation may be created, acquired, or stolen by the adversary. Unlike [Invalid Code Signature](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001), this activity will result in a valid signature.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/003)

[SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/003)

Adversaries may tamper with SIP and trust provider components to mislead the operating system and application control tools when conducting signature validation checks. In user mode, Windows Authenticode digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, variables that may be used to establish trust in signed code (ex: a driver with a valid Microsoft signature may be handled as safe). The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface (API) function, which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004)

[Install Root Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004)

Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers. Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/005)

[Mark-of-the-Web Bypass](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/005)

Adversaries may abuse specific file formats to subvert Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) controls. In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named Zone.Identifier with a specific value known as the MOTW. Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions. For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View. Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables. If the file is not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/006)

[Code Signing Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/006)

Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of unsigned or self-signed code. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a program from a developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on an operating system.

[System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082)

An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture. Adversaries may use the information from [System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

[T1614](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614)

[System Location Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614)

Adversaries may gather information in an attempt to calculate the geographical location of a victim host. Adversaries may use the information from [System Location Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614/001)

[System Language Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1614/001)

Adversaries may attempt to gather information about the system language of a victim in order to infer the geographical location of that host. This information may be used to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether the adversary infects the target and/or attempts specific actions. This decision may be employed by malware developers and operators to reduce their risk of attracting the attention of specific law enforcement agencies or prosecution/scrutiny from other entities.

[T1016](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016)

[System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016)

Adversaries may look for details about the network configuration and settings, such as IP and/or MAC addresses, of systems they access or through information discovery of remote systems. Several operating system administration utilities exist that can be used to gather this information. Examples include [Arp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0099), [ipconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0100)/[ifconfig](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0101), [nbtstat](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0102), and [route](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0103).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/001)

[Internet Connection Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/001)

Adversaries may check for Internet connectivity on compromised systems. This may be performed during automated discovery and can be accomplished in numerous ways such as using [Ping](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0097), tracert, and GET requests to websites.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/002)

[Wi-Fi Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/002)

Adversaries may search for information about Wi-Fi networks, such as network names and passwords, on compromised systems. Adversaries may use Wi-Fi information as part of [Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087), [Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1018), and other discovery or [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) activity to support both ongoing and future campaigns.

[T1049](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1049)

[System Network Connections Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1049)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network.

[T1033](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033)

[System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033)

Adversaries may attempt to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, set of users that commonly uses a system, or whether a user is actively using the system. They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.

[T1216](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1216)

[System Script Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1216)

Adversaries may use trusted scripts, often signed with certificates, to proxy the execution of malicious files. Several Microsoft signed scripts that have been downloaded from Microsoft or are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files. This behavior may be abused by adversaries to execute malicious files that could bypass application control and signature validation on systems.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1216/001)

[PubPrn](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1216/001)

Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote files. PubPrn.vbs is a [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005) script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services. The script may be signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) via Cscript.exe. For example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain: cscript pubprn Printer1 LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1216/002)

[SyncAppvPublishingServer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1216/002)

Adversaries may abuse SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs to proxy execution of malicious [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) commands. SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs is a Visual Basic script associated with how Windows virtualizes applications (Microsoft Application Virtualization, or App-V). For example, Windows may render Win32 applications to users as virtual applications, allowing users to launch and interact with them as if they were installed locally.

[T1007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007)

[System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007)

Adversaries may try to gather information about registered local system services. Adversaries may obtain information about services using tools as well as OS utility commands such as sc query, tasklist /svc, systemctl --type=service, and net start.

[T1569](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569)

[System Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569)

Adversaries may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. Adversaries can execute malicious content by interacting with or creating services either locally or remotely. Many services are set to run at boot, which can aid in achieving persistence ([Create or Modify System Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)), but adversaries can also abuse services for one-time or temporary execution.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001)

[Launchctl](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001)

Adversaries may abuse launchctl to execute commands or programs. Launchctl interfaces with launchd, the service management framework for macOS. Launchctl supports taking subcommands on the command-line, interactively, or even redirected from standard input.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002)

[Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002)

Adversaries may abuse the Windows service control manager to execute malicious commands or payloads. The Windows service control manager (services.exe) is an interface to manage and manipulate services. The service control manager is accessible to users via GUI components as well as system utilities such as sc.exe and [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).

[T1529](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529)

[System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529)

Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device via [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) (e.g. reload).

[T1124](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1124)

[System Time Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1124)

An adversary may gather the system time and/or time zone settings from a local or remote system. The system time is set and stored by services, such as the Windows Time Service on Windows or systemsetup on macOS. These time settings may also be synchronized between systems and services in an enterprise network, typically accomplished with a network time server within a domain.

[T1080](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1080)

[Taint Shared Content](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1080)

Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.

[T1221](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)

[Template Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1221)

Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts. For example, Microsoft�s Office Open XML (OOXML) specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt). OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.

[T1205](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

[Traffic Signaling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

[Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

[Socket Filters](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the libpcap library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

[T1537](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537)

[Transfer Data to Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including through sharing/syncing and creating backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service.

[T1127](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127)

[Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127)

Adversaries may take advantage of trusted developer utilities to proxy execution of malicious payloads. There are many utilities used for software development related tasks that can be used to execute code in various forms to assist in development, debugging, and reverse engineering. These utilities may often be signed with legitimate certificates that allow them to execute on a system and proxy execution of malicious code through a trusted process that effectively bypasses application control solutions.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127/001)

[MSBuild](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127/001)

Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. MSBuild.exe (Microsoft Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It handles XML formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.

[T1199](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)

[Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)

Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.

[T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)

[Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)

Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. [Bash History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. [Credentials in Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)), or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001)

[Credentials In Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001)

Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing insecurely stored credentials. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)

[Credentials in Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)

Adversaries may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs. Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services. Sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)

[Bash History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)

Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user�s .bash\_history file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: ~/.bash\_history. Typically, this file keeps track of the user�s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)

[Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)

Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/005)

[Cloud Instance Metadata API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/005)

Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/006)

[Group Policy Preferences](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/006)

Adversaries may attempt to find unsecured credentials in Group Policy Preferences (GPP). GPP are tools that allow administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. These policies allow administrators to set local accounts.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/007)

[Container API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/007)

Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment. APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/008)

[Chat Messages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/008)

Adversaries may directly collect unsecured credentials stored or passed through user communication services. Credentials may be sent and stored in user chat communication applications such as email, chat services like Slack or Teams, collaboration tools like Jira or Trello, and any other services that support user communication. Users may share various forms of credentials (such as usernames and passwords, API keys, or authentication tokens) on private or public corporate internal communications channels.

[T1535](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535)

[Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535)

Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection. Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.

[T1550](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550)

[Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550)

Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001)

[Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001)

Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)

[Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)

Adversaries may "pass the hash" using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003)

[Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003)

Adversaries may "pass the ticket" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004)

[Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004)

Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.

[T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)

[User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)

An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001)

[Malicious Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001)

An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002). Clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). Links may also lead users to download files that require execution via [Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)

[Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)

An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001). Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/003)

[Malicious Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/003)

Adversaries may rely on a user running a malicious image to facilitate execution. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be backdoored. Backdoored images may be uploaded to a public repository via [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001), and users may then download and deploy an instance or container from the image without realizing the image is malicious, thus bypassing techniques that specifically achieve Initial Access. This can lead to the execution of malicious code, such as code that executes cryptocurrency mining, in the instance or container.

[T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

[Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

[Default Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS and the default service account in Kubernetes.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

[Domain Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a domain account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

[Local Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a local account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.

[T1125](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1125)

[Video Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1125)

An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.

[T1497](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)

[Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)

Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/001)

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003)

[Time Based Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/003)

Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include enumerating time-based properties, such as uptime or the system clock, as well as the use of timers or other triggers to avoid a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox, specifically those that are automated or only operate for a limited amount of time.

[T1600](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600)

[Weaken Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600)

Adversaries may compromise a network device�s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/001)

[Reduce Key Space](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/001)

Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/002)

[Disable Crypto Hardware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1600/002)

Adversaries disable a network device�s dedicated hardware encryption, which may enable them to leverage weaknesses in software encryption in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting, manipulating, and exfiltrating transmitted data.

[T1102](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)

[Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system. Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001)

[Dead Drop Resolver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/002)

[Bidirectional Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/002)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to and receiving output from a compromised system over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems can then send the output from those commands back over that Web service channel. The return traffic may occur in a variety of ways, depending on the Web service being utilized. For example, the return traffic may take the form of the compromised system posting a comment on a forum, issuing a pull request to development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service, or by sending a Tweet.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/003)

[One-Way Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/003)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.

[T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)

[Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)

Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads. WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows systems. WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.

[T1220](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1220)

[XSL Script Processing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1220)

Adversaries may bypass application control and obscure execution of code by embedding scripts inside XSL files. Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages.

Reconnaissance
==============

The adversary is trying to gather information they can use to plan future operations.

Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. Such information may include details of the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute Initial Access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance efforts.

Instead of compromising a third-party [Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004) or renting a [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003), adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations. Free trial periods of cloud servers may also be abused.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/005)

[Botnet](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/005)

Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent a network of compromised systems that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006)

[Web Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/006)

Adversaries may register for web services that can be used during targeting. A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. By utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007)

[Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007)

Adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008)

[Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008)

Adversaries may purchase online advertisements that can be abused to distribute malware to victims. Ads can be purchased to plant as well as favorably position artifacts in specific locations online, such as prominently placed within search engine results. These ads may make it more difficult for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements. Purchased ads may also target specific audiences using the advertising network�s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage of the trust inherently given to search engines and popular websites.

[T1586](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)

[Compromise Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586)

Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating accounts (i.e. [Establish Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585)), adversaries may compromise existing accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/001)

[Social Media Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/001)

Adversaries may compromise social media accounts that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating social media profiles (i.e. [Social Media Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1585/001)), adversaries may compromise existing social media accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona.

Adversaries can use compromised email accounts to further their operations, such as leveraging them to conduct [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), or large-scale spam email campaigns. Utilizing an existing persona with a compromised email account may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship with, or knowledge of, the compromised persona. Compromised email accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure (ex: [Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/003)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1586/003)

Adversaries may compromise cloud accounts that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can use compromised cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets for [Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002) or to [Upload Tool](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/002)s. Cloud accounts can also be used in the acquisition of infrastructure, such as [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003)s or [Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/007) infrastructure. Compromising cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.

[T1584](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)

[Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)

Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, network devices, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle. Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/001)

[Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/001)

Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting. Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant. Adversaries may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain. The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration. Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account or taking advantage of renewal process gaps.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/002)

[DNS Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/002)

Adversaries may compromise third-party DNS servers that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex: [Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004)

[Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/004)

Adversaries may compromise third-party servers that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, including for Command and Control. Instead of purchasing a [Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/004) or [Virtual Private Server](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/003), adversaries may compromise third-party servers in support of operations.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/005)

[Botnet](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/005)

Adversaries may compromise numerous third-party systems to form a botnet that can be used during targeting. A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks. Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems. Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/006)

[Web Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/006)

Adversaries may compromise access to third-party web services that can be used during targeting. A variety of popular websites exist for legitimate users to register for web-based services, such as GitHub, Twitter, Dropbox, Google, SendGrid, etc. Adversaries may try to take ownership of a legitimate user's access to a web service and use that web service as infrastructure in support of cyber operations. Such web services can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ([Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)), [Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567), or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566). Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. By utilizing a web service, particularly when access is stolen from legitimate users, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. Additionally, leveraging compromised web-based email services may allow adversaries to leverage the trust associated with legitimate domains.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/007)

[Serverless](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584/007)

Adversaries may compromise serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/002)

[Code Signing Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/002)

Adversaries may create self-signed code signing certificates that can be used during targeting. Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/003)

[Digital Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/003)

Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner. In the case of self-signing, digital certificates will lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority (CA).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/004)

[Exploits](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/004)

Adversaries may develop exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software.

Name

Description

[T1659](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1659)

[Content Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1659)

Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004) followed by [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)), adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) and other data to already compromised systems.

[T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)

[Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)

Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).

[T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190)

[Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190)

Adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially access a network. The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration.

[T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)

[External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)

Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.

[T1200](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1200)

[Hardware Additions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1200)

Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage (i.e. [Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)), more robust hardware additions can be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can then be abused.

[T1566](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)

[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566)

Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)

[Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001)

Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)

[Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002)

Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003)

[Spearphishing via Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/003)

Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/004)

[Spearphishing Voice](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/004)

Adversaries may use voice communications to ultimately gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing voice is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that is employs the use of manipulating a user into providing access to systems through a phone call or other forms of voice communications. Spearphishing frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source (ex: [Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.

[T1091](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)

[Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)

Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.

[T1195](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195)

[Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195)

Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/001)

[Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/001)

Adversaries may manipulate software dependencies and development tools prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Applications often depend on external software to function properly. Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002)

[Compromise Software Supply Chain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/002)

Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Supply chain compromise of software can take place in a number of ways, including manipulation of the application source code, manipulation of the update/distribution mechanism for that software, or replacing compiled releases with a modified version.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/003)

[Compromise Hardware Supply Chain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195/003)

Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.

[T1199](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)

[Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)

Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.

[T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

[Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

[Default Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS and the default service account in Kubernetes.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

[Domain Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a domain account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

[Local Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a local account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.

Execution
=========

The adversary is trying to run malicious code.

Execution consists of techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system. Techniques that run malicious code are often paired with techniques from all other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing data. For example, an adversary might use a remote access tool to run a PowerShell script that does Remote System Discovery.

ID

Name

Description

[T1651](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1651)

[Cloud Administration Command](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1651)

Adversaries may abuse cloud management services to execute commands within virtual machines. Resources such as AWS Systems Manager, Azure RunCommand, and Runbooks allow users to remotely run scripts in virtual machines by leveraging installed virtual machine agents.

[T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)

[Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059)

Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004) while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003) and [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)

[PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001)

Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the `Start-Process` cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002)

[AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002)

Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution. AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents. These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript. These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003)

[Windows Command Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/003)

Adversaries may abuse the Windows command shell for execution. The Windows command shell ([cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106)) is the primary command prompt on Windows systems. The Windows command prompt can be used to control almost any aspect of a system, with various permission levels required for different subsets of commands. The command prompt can be invoked remotely via [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)

[Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)

Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution. Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005)

[Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005)

Adversaries may abuse Visual Basic (VB) for execution. VB is a programming language created by Microsoft with interoperability with many Windows technologies such as [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) and the [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) through the Windows API. Although tagged as legacy with no planned future evolutions, VB is integrated and supported in the .NET Framework and cross-platform .NET Core.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006)

[Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006)

Adversaries may abuse Python commands and scripts for execution. Python is a very popular scripting/programming language, with capabilities to perform many functions. Python can be executed interactively from the command-line (via the `python.exe` interpreter) or via scripts (.py) that can be written and distributed to different systems. Python code can also be compiled into binary executables.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007)

[JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007)

Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript for execution. JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language (compiled just-in-time at runtime) commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though JS can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)

[Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008)

Adversaries may abuse scripting or built-in command line interpreters (CLI) on network devices to execute malicious command and payloads. The CLI is the primary means through which users and administrators interact with the device in order to view system information, modify device operations, or perform diagnostic and administrative functions. CLIs typically contain various permission levels required for different commands.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)

[Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009)

Adversaries may abuse cloud APIs to execute malicious commands. APIs available in cloud environments provide various functionalities and are a feature-rich method for programmatic access to nearly all aspects of a tenant. These APIs may be utilized through various methods such as command line interpreters (CLIs), in-browser Cloud Shells, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) modules like Azure for PowerShell, or software developer kits (SDKs) available for languages such as [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006).

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/010)

[AutoHotKey & AutoIT](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/010)

Adversaries may execute commands and perform malicious tasks using AutoIT and AutoHotKey automation scripts. AutoIT and AutoHotkey (AHK) are scripting languages that enable users to automate Windows tasks. These automation scripts can be used to perform a wide variety of actions, such as clicking on buttons, entering text, and opening and closing programs.

[T1609](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1609)

[Container Administration Command](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1609)

Adversaries may abuse a container administration service to execute commands within a container. A container administration service such as the Docker daemon, the Kubernetes API server, or the kubelet may allow remote management of containers within an environment.

[T1610](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)

[Deploy Container](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)

Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment. In Kubernetes environments, an adversary may attempt to deploy a privileged or vulnerable container into a specific node in order to [Escape to Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611) and access other containers running on the node.

[T1203](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203)

[Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.

[T1559](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559)

[Inter-Process Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559)

Adversaries may abuse inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms for local code or command execution. IPC is typically used by processes to share data, communicate with each other, or synchronize execution. IPC is also commonly used to avoid situations such as deadlocks, which occurs when processes are stuck in a cyclic waiting pattern.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001)

[Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001)

Adversaries may use the Windows Component Object Model (COM) for local code execution. COM is an inter-process communication (IPC) component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces. Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically binary Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE). Remote COM execution is facilitated by [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) such as [Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003) (DCOM).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002)

[Dynamic Data Exchange](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/002)

Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/003)

[XPC Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/003)

Adversaries can provide malicious content to an XPC service daemon for local code execution. macOS uses XPC services for basic inter-process communication between various processes, such as between the XPC Service daemon and third-party application privileged helper tools. Applications can send messages to the XPC Service daemon, which runs as root, using the low-level XPC Service `C API` or the high level `NSXPCConnection API` in order to handle tasks that require elevated privileges (such as network connections). Applications are responsible for providing the protocol definition which serves as a blueprint of the XPC services. Developers typically use XPC Services to provide applications stability and privilege separation between the application client and the daemon.

[T1106](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)

[Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)

Adversaries may interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to execute behaviors. Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.

[T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)

[Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/002)

[At](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/002)

Adversaries may abuse the [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Although deprecated in favor of [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)'s [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) in Windows environments, using [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003)

[Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003)

Adversaries may abuse the `cron` utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The `cron` utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems. The `crontab` file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution. Any `crontab` files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)

[Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)

Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/006)

[Systemd Timers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/006)

Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Systemd timers are unit files with file extension `.timer` that control services. Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point. They can be used as an alternative to [Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003) in Linux environments. Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the `systemctl` command line utility, which operates over [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/007)

[Container Orchestration Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/007)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.

[T1648](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1648)

[Serverless Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1648)

Adversaries may abuse serverless computing, integration, and automation services to execute arbitrary code in cloud environments. Many cloud providers offer a variety of serverless resources, including compute engines, application integration services, and web servers.

[T1129](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)

[Shared Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)

Adversaries may execute malicious payloads via loading shared modules. Shared modules are executable files that are loaded into processes to provide access to reusable code, such as specific custom functions or invoking OS API functions (i.e., [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)).

[T1072](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072)

[Software Deployment Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072)

Adversaries may gain access to and use centralized software suites installed within an enterprise to execute commands and move laterally through the network. Configuration management and software deployment applications may be used in an enterprise network or cloud environment for routine administration purposes. These systems may also be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Examples of such solutions include: SCCM, HBSS, Altiris, AWS Systems Manager, Microsoft Intune, Azure Arc, and GCP Deployment Manager.

[T1569](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569)

[System Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569)

Adversaries may abuse system services or daemons to execute commands or programs. Adversaries can execute malicious content by interacting with or creating services either locally or remotely. Many services are set to run at boot, which can aid in achieving persistence ([Create or Modify System Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)), but adversaries can also abuse services for one-time or temporary execution.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001)

[Launchctl](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001)

Adversaries may abuse launchctl to execute commands or programs. Launchctl interfaces with launchd, the service management framework for macOS. Launchctl supports taking subcommands on the command-line, interactively, or even redirected from standard input.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002)

[Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002)

Adversaries may abuse the Windows service control manager to execute malicious commands or payloads. The Windows service control manager (`services.exe`) is an interface to manage and manipulate services. The service control manager is accessible to users via GUI components as well as system utilities such as `sc.exe` and [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039).

[T1204](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)

[User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)

An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001)

[Malicious Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001)

An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to click on a link that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002). Clicking on a link may also lead to other execution techniques such as exploitation of a browser or application vulnerability via [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203). Links may also lead users to download files that require execution via [Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)

[Malicious File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/002)

An adversary may rely upon a user opening a malicious file in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to open a file that will lead to code execution. This user action will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001). Adversaries may use several types of files that require a user to execute them, including .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, and .cpl.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/003)

[Malicious Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/003)

Adversaries may rely on a user running a malicious image to facilitate execution. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be backdoored. Backdoored images may be uploaded to a public repository via [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001), and users may then download and deploy an instance or container from the image without realizing the image is malicious, thus bypassing techniques that specifically achieve Initial Access. This can lead to the execution of malicious code, such as code that executes cryptocurrency mining, in the instance or container.

[T1047](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)

[Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047)

Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads. WMI is designed for programmers and is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows systems. WMI is an administration feature that provides a uniform environment to access Windows system components.

Persistence
===========

The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold.

Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or adding startup code.

Description

[T1098](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098)

[Account Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098)

Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)

[Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)

Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/002)

[Additional Email Delegate Permissions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/002)

Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)

[Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)

An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant. For example, adversaries may update IAM policies in cloud-based environments or add a new global administrator in Office 365 environments. With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings (including the ability to reset the passwords of other admins).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004)

[SSH Authorized Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004)

Adversaries may modify the SSH `authorized_keys` file to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management. The `authorized_keys` file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the user's home directory under `<user-home>/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Users may edit the system�s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value "yes" to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled. The SSH config file is usually located under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005)

[Device Registration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005)

Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/006)

[Additional Container Cluster Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/006)

An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled user or service account to maintain persistent access to a container orchestration system. For example, an adversary with sufficient permissions may create a RoleBinding or a ClusterRoleBinding to bind a Role or ClusterRole to a Kubernetes account. Where attribute-based access control (ABAC) is in use, an adversary with sufficient permissions may modify a Kubernetes ABAC policy to give the target account additional permissions.

[T1197](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1197)

[BITS Jobs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1197)

Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM). BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

[T1547](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547)

[Boot or Logon Autostart Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547)

Adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems. Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon. These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)

[Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)

Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/002)

[Authentication Package](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/002)

Adversaries may abuse authentication packages to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows authentication package DLLs are loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. They provide support for multiple logon processes and multiple security protocols to the operating system.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/003)

[Time Providers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/003)

Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains. W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/004)

[Winlogon Helper DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/004)

Adversaries may abuse features of Winlogon to execute DLLs and/or executables when a user logs in. Winlogon.exe is a Windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete. Registry entries in `HKLM\Software[\Wow6432Node\]\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` and `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/005)

[Security Support Provider](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/005)

Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006)

[Kernel Modules and Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006)

Adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system. 

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)

[Re-opened Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)

Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to "Reopen windows when logging back in". When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named `com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist` within the `~/Library/Preferences/ByHost` directory. Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user�s next logon.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/008)

[LSASS Driver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/008)

Adversaries may modify or add LSASS drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems. The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009)

[Shortcut Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009)

Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010)

[Port Monitors](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010)

Adversaries may use port monitors to run an adversary supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation. A port monitor can be set through the `AddMonitor` API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup. This DLL can be located in `C:\Windows\System32` and will be loaded and run by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, under SYSTEM level permissions on boot.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/012)

[Print Processors](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/012)

Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, during boot.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013)

[XDG Autostart Entries](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013)

Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user�s desktop environment is loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files (`.desktop`) to configure the user�s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/014)

[Active Setup](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/014)

Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/015)

[Login Items](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/015)

Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges. Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in. Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework. Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call `SMLoginItemSetEnabled`.

[T1037](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)

[Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)

Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence. Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

[Logon Script (Windows)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. This is done via adding a path to a script to the `HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript` Registry key.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/002)

[Login Hook](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/002)

Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon. A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. The plist file is located in the `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist` file and can be modified using the `defaults` command-line utility. This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003)

[Network Logon Script](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003)

Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects. These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)

[RC Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)

Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system�s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005)

[Startup Items](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005)

Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.

[T1176](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176)

[Browser Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176)

Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems. Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.

[T1554](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1554)

[Compromise Host Software Binary](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1554)

Adversaries may modify host software binaries to establish persistent access to systems. Software binaries/executables provide a wide range of system commands or services, programs, and libraries. Common software binaries are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, web browsers, and many other user or server applications.

[T1136](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)

[Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)

Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/001)

[Local Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/001)

Adversaries may create a local account to maintain access to victim systems. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/002)

[Domain Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/002)

Adversaries may create a domain account to maintain access to victim systems. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover user, administrator, and service accounts. With a sufficient level of access, the `net user /add /domain` command can be used to create a domain account.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/003)

[Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136/003)

Adversaries may create a cloud account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that does not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

[T1543](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)

[Create or Modify System Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)

Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services. On macOS, launchd processes known as [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) and [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001) are run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)

[Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)

Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) file found in `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`, `/Library/LaunchAgents`, and `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. Property list files use the `Label`, `ProgramArguments` , and `RunAtLoad` keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time. Launch Agents are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002)

[Systemd Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002)

Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Systemd is a system and service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources. Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)

[Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)

Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions. Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)

[Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)

Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`. Required Launch Daemons parameters include a `Label` to identify the task, `Program` to provide a path to the executable, and `RunAtLoad` to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/005)

[Container Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/005)

Adversaries may create or modify container or container cluster management tools that run as daemons, agents, or services on individual hosts. These include software for creating and managing individual containers, such as Docker and Podman, as well as container cluster node-level agents such as kubelet. By modifying these services, an adversary may be able to achieve persistence or escalate their privileges on a host.

[T1546](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)

[Event Triggered Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. Cloud environments may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001)

[Change Default File Association](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association. When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility. Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/002)

[Screensaver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/002)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension. The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in `C:\Windows\System32\`, and `C:\Windows\sysWOW64\` on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/003)

[Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/003)

Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription. WMI can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user login, or the computer's uptime.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004)

[Unix Shell Configuration Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004)

Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user�s shell. User [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (`/etc`) and the user�s home directory (`~/`) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user�s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005)

[Trap](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal. The `trap` command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+d`.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/006)

[LC\_LOAD\_DYLIB Addition](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/006)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries. Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. The LC\_LOAD\_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies. There are tools available to perform these changes.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/007)

[Netsh Helper DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/007)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility. The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh`.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008)

[Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/009)

[AppCert DLLs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/009)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the `AppCertDLLs` Registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\` are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface (API) functions `CreateProcess`, `CreateProcessAsUser`, `CreateProcessWithLoginW`, `CreateProcessWithTokenW`, or `WinExec`.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/010)

[AppInit DLLs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/010)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the `AppInit_DLLs` value in the Registry keys `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads user32.dll. In practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/011)

[Application Shimming](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/011)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims. The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)

[Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers. IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application�s IFEO will be prepended to the application�s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., `C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g notepad.exe`).

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/013)

[PowerShell Profile](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/013)

Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles. A PowerShell profile (`profile.ps1`) is a script that runs when [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/014)

[Emond](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/014)

Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond). Emond is a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at `/sbin/emond` will load any rules from the `/etc/emond.d/rules/` directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015)

[Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system. References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.

[.016](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/016)

[Installer Packages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/016)

Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.

[T1133](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)

[External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133)

Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.

[T1574](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

[Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

[DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

[DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

[Dylib Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with `@rpath`, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable. Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB` function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

[Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

[Dynamic Linker Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as `LD_PRELOAD` on Linux or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

[Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

[Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

[Path Interception by Unquoted Path](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

[Services File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

[Services Registry Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

[COR\_PROFILER](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

Adversaries may leverage the COR\_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR\_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

[KernelCallbackTable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

Adversaries may abuse the `KernelCallbackTable` of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads. The `KernelCallbackTable` can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once `user32.dll` is loaded.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

[AppDomainManager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking how the .NET `AppDomainManager` loads assemblies. The .NET framework uses the `AppDomainManager` class to create and manage one or more isolated runtime environments (called application domains) inside a process to host the execution of .NET applications. Assemblies (`.exe` or `.dll` binaries compiled to run as .NET code) may be loaded into an application domain as executable code.

[T1525](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1525)

[Implant Internal Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1525)

Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored. Unlike [Upload Malware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/001), this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim�s environment. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.

[T1556](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

[Modify Authentication Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

[Domain Controller Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

[Password Filter DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

[Pluggable Authentication Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is `pam_unix.so`, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

[Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

Adversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

[Reversible Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The `AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption` property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

Adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

[Hybrid Identity](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

[Network Provider DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

Adversaries may register malicious network provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to capture cleartext user credentials during the authentication process. Network provider DLLs allow Windows to interface with specific network protocols and can also support add-on credential management functions. During the logon process, Winlogon (the interactive logon module) sends credentials to the local `mpnotify.exe` process via RPC. The `mpnotify.exe` process then shares the credentials in cleartext with registered credential managers when notifying that a logon event is happening.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

[Conditional Access Policies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.

[T1137](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137)

[Office Application Startup](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137)

Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups. Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/001)

[Office Template Macros](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/001)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office templates to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Microsoft Office contains templates that are part of common Office applications and are used to customize styles. The base templates within the application are used each time an application starts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/002)

[Office Test](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/002)

Adversaries may abuse the Microsoft Office "Office Test" Registry key to obtain persistence on a compromised system. An Office Test Registry location exists that allows a user to specify an arbitrary DLL that will be executed every time an Office application is started. This Registry key is thought to be used by Microsoft to load DLLs for testing and debugging purposes while developing Office applications. This Registry key is not created by default during an Office installation.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/003)

[Outlook Forms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/003)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook forms to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook forms are used as templates for presentation and functionality in Outlook messages. Custom Outlook forms can be created that will execute code when a specifically crafted email is sent by an adversary utilizing the same custom Outlook form.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/004)

[Outlook Home Page](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/004)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders. This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented whenever a folder is opened. A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/005)

[Outlook Rules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/005)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email messages. A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific sender. Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/006)

[Add-ins](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1137/006)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Office add-ins to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Office add-ins can be used to add functionality to Office programs. There are different types of add-ins that can be used by the various Office products; including Word/Excel add-in Libraries (WLL/XLL), VBA add-ins, Office Component Object Model (COM) add-ins, automation add-ins, VBA Editor (VBE), Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO) add-ins, and Outlook add-ins.

[T1653](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1653)

[Power Settings](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1653)

Adversaries may impair a system's ability to hibernate, reboot, or shut down in order to extend access to infected machines. When a computer enters a dormant state, some or all software and hardware may cease to operate which can disrupt malicious activity.

[T1542](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542)

[Pre-OS Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542)

Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence on a system. During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup services are loaded before the operating system. These programs control flow of execution before the operating system takes control.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001)

[System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001)

Adversaries may modify system firmware to persist on systems.The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) are examples of system firmware that operate as the software interface between the operating system and hardware of a computer.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/002)

[Component Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/002)

Adversaries may modify component firmware to persist on systems. Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS. This technique may be similar to [System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001) but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/003)

[Bootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/003)

Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems. Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)

[ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)

Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005)

[TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005)

Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP boot (netbooting) is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server. Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images.

[T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)

[Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/002)

[At](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/002)

Adversaries may abuse the [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Although deprecated in favor of [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)'s [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) in Windows environments, using [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003)

[Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003)

Adversaries may abuse the `cron` utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The `cron` utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems. The `crontab` file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution. Any `crontab` files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)

[Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)

Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/006)

[Systemd Timers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/006)

Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Systemd timers are unit files with file extension `.timer` that control services. Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point. They can be used as an alternative to [Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003) in Linux environments. Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the `systemctl` command line utility, which operates over [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/007)

[Container Orchestration Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/007)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.

[T1505](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505)

[Server Software Component](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505)

Adversaries may abuse legitimate extensible development features of servers to establish persistent access to systems. Enterprise server applications may include features that allow developers to write and install software or scripts to extend the functionality of the main application. Adversaries may install malicious components to extend and abuse server applications.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/001)

[SQL Stored Procedures](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/001)

Adversaries may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems. SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries. Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application is started/restarted).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/002)

[Transport Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/002)

Adversaries may abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems. Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails. Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server. Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)

[Web Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/003)

Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to access the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/004)

[IIS Components](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/004)

Adversaries may install malicious components that run on Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers to establish persistence. IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers. For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests. Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions: `Get{Extension/Filter}Version`, `Http{Extension/Filter}Proc`, and (optionally) `Terminate{Extension/Filter}`. IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/005)

[Terminal Services DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/005)

Adversaries may abuse components of Terminal Services to enable persistent access to systems. Microsoft Terminal Services, renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, enable remote terminal connections to hosts. Terminal Services allows servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via RDP.

[T1205](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

[Traffic Signaling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

[Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

[Socket Filters](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

[T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

[Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

[Default Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS and the default service account in Kubernetes.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

[Domain Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a domain account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

[Local Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a local account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.

Privilege Escalation
====================

The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities. Examples of elevated access include:

*   SYSTEM/root level
*   local administrator
*   user account with admin-like access
*   user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific function

These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.

ID

Name

Description

[T1548](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548)

[Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548)

Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001)

[Setuid and Setgid](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001)

An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user�s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. Normally an application is run in the current user�s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)

[Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)

Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003)

[Sudo and Sudo Caching](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003)

Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/004)

[Elevated Execution with Prompt](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/004)

Adversaries may leverage the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials. The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating. This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)

[Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)

Adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources. Many cloud environments allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges that may be distinct from their own.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/006)

[TCC Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/006)

Adversaries can manipulate or abuse the Transparency, Consent, & Control (TCC) service or database to execute malicious applications with elevated permissions. TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).

[T1134](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134)

[Access Token Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134)

Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)

[Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)

Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using `DuplicateToken` or `DuplicateTokenEx`. The token can then be used with `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with `SetThreadToken` to assign the impersonated token to a thread.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)

[Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)

Adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as `CreateProcessWithTokenW` and `runas`.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

[Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the `LogonUser` function. The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use `SetThreadToken` to assign the token to a thread.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)

[Parent PID Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)

Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the `CreateProcess` API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use. This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via `svchost.exe` or `consent.exe`) rather than the current user context.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005)

[SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005)

Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute , allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).

[T1098](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098)

[Account Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098)

Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)

[Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001)

Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/002)

[Additional Email Delegate Permissions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/002)

Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)

[Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003)

An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant. For example, adversaries may update IAM policies in cloud-based environments or add a new global administrator in Office 365 environments. With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings (including the ability to reset the passwords of other admins).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004)

[SSH Authorized Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/004)

Adversaries may modify the SSH `authorized_keys` file to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management. The `authorized_keys` file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the user's home directory under `<user-home>/.ssh/authorized_keys`. Users may edit the system�s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value "yes" to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled. The SSH config file is usually located under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005)

[Device Registration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/005)

Adversaries may register a device to an adversary-controlled account. Devices may be registered in a multifactor authentication (MFA) system, which handles authentication to the network, or in a device management system, which handles device access and compliance.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/006)

[Additional Container Cluster Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/006)

An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled user or service account to maintain persistent access to a container orchestration system. For example, an adversary with sufficient permissions may create a RoleBinding or a ClusterRoleBinding to bind a Role or ClusterRole to a Kubernetes account. Where attribute-based access control (ABAC) is in use, an adversary with sufficient permissions may modify a Kubernetes ABAC policy to give the target account additional permissions.

[T1547](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547)

[Boot or Logon Autostart Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547)

Adversaries may configure system settings to automatically execute a program during system boot or logon to maintain persistence or gain higher-level privileges on compromised systems. Operating systems may have mechanisms for automatically running a program on system boot or account logon. These mechanisms may include automatically executing programs that are placed in specially designated directories or are referenced by repositories that store configuration information, such as the Windows Registry. An adversary may achieve the same goal by modifying or extending features of the kernel.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)

[Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/001)

Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the "run keys" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/002)

[Authentication Package](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/002)

Adversaries may abuse authentication packages to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows authentication package DLLs are loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. They provide support for multiple logon processes and multiple security protocols to the operating system.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/003)

[Time Providers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/003)

Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains. W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/004)

[Winlogon Helper DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/004)

Adversaries may abuse features of Winlogon to execute DLLs and/or executables when a user logs in. Winlogon.exe is a Windows component responsible for actions at logon/logoff as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by Ctrl-Alt-Delete. Registry entries in `HKLM\Software[\Wow6432Node\]\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` and `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\` are used to manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support Winlogon.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/005)

[Security Support Provider](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/005)

Adversaries may abuse security support providers (SSPs) to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006)

[Kernel Modules and Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/006)

Adversaries may modify the kernel to automatically execute programs on system boot. Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system. 

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)

[Re-opened Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)

Adversaries may modify plist files to automatically run an application when a user logs in. When a user logs out or restarts via the macOS Graphical User Interface (GUI), a prompt is provided to the user with a checkbox to "Reopen windows when logging back in". When selected, all applications currently open are added to a property list file named `com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist` within the `~/Library/Preferences/ByHost` directory. Applications listed in this file are automatically reopened upon the user�s next logon.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/008)

[LSASS Driver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/008)

Adversaries may modify or add LSASS drivers to obtain persistence on compromised systems. The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain. The Local Security Authority (LSA) is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication. The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service (LSASS) lsass.exe process.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009)

[Shortcut Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/009)

Adversaries may create or modify shortcuts that can execute a program during system boot or user login. Shortcuts or symbolic links are used to reference other files or programs that will be opened or executed when the shortcut is clicked or executed by a system startup process.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010)

[Port Monitors](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/010)

Adversaries may use port monitors to run an adversary supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation. A port monitor can be set through the `AddMonitor` API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup. This DLL can be located in `C:\Windows\System32` and will be loaded and run by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, under SYSTEM level permissions on boot.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/012)

[Print Processors](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/012)

Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, during boot.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013)

[XDG Autostart Entries](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/013)

Adversaries may add or modify XDG Autostart Entries to execute malicious programs or commands when a user�s desktop environment is loaded at login. XDG Autostart entries are available for any XDG-compliant Linux system. XDG Autostart entries use Desktop Entry files (`.desktop`) to configure the user�s desktop environment upon user login. These configuration files determine what applications launch upon user login, define associated applications to open specific file types, and define applications used to open removable media.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/014)

[Active Setup](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/014)

Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer. These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/015)

[Login Items](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/015)

Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges. Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in. Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework. Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call `SMLoginItemSetEnabled`.

[T1037](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)

[Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037)

Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence. Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

[Logon Script (Windows)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/001)

Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system. This is done via adding a path to a script to the `HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript` Registry key.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/002)

[Login Hook](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/002)

Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon. A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon. The plist file is located in the `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist` file and can be modified using the `defaults` command-line utility. This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout. All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003)

[Network Logon Script](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/003)

Adversaries may use network logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Network logon scripts can be assigned using Active Directory or Group Policy Objects. These logon scripts run with the privileges of the user they are assigned to. Depending on the systems within the network, initializing one of these scripts could apply to more than one or potentially all systems.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)

[RC Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/004)

Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system�s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005)

[Startup Items](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1037/005)

Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence. Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.

[T1543](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)

[Create or Modify System Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543)

Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services. On macOS, launchd processes known as [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) and [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001) are run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)

[Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)

Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When a user logs in, a per-user launchd process is started which loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand user agent from the property list (.plist) file found in `/System/Library/LaunchAgents`, `/Library/LaunchAgents`, and `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. Property list files use the `Label`, `ProgramArguments` , and `RunAtLoad` keys to identify the Launch Agent's name, executable location, and execution time. Launch Agents are often installed to perform updates to programs, launch user specified programs at login, or to conduct other developer tasks.

[Systemd Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/002)

Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Systemd is a system and service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources. Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)

[Windows Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003)

Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions. Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)

[Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)

Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`. Required Launch Daemons parameters include a `Label` to identify the task, `Program` to provide a path to the executable, and `RunAtLoad` to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/005)

[Container Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/005)

Adversaries may create or modify container or container cluster management tools that run as daemons, agents, or services on individual hosts. These include software for creating and managing individual containers, such as Docker and Podman, as well as container cluster node-level agents such as kubelet. By modifying these services, an adversary may be able to achieve persistence or escalate their privileges on a host.

[T1484](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)

[Domain or Tenant Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)

Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain or identity tenant to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in centrally managed environments. Such services provide a centralized means of managing identity resources such as devices and accounts, and often include configuration settings that may apply between domains or tenants such as trust relationships, identity syncing, or identity federation.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/001)

[Group Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/001)

Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the intention of escalating privileges on the domain. Group policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD). GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predictable network path `\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\`.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002)

[Trust Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002)

Adversaries may add new domain trusts, modify the properties of existing domain trusts, or otherwise change the configuration of trust relationships between domains and tenants to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges.Trust details, such as whether or not user identities are federated, allow authentication and authorization properties to apply between domains or tenants for the purpose of accessing shared resources. These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication material applied to servers, tokens, and domains.

[T1611](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611)

[Escape to Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611)

Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host. This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself. In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.

[T1546](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)

[Event Triggered Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. Cloud environments may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001)

[Change Default File Association](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/001)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by a file type association. When a file is opened, the default program used to open the file (also called the file association or handler) is checked. File association selections are stored in the Windows Registry and can be edited by users, administrators, or programs that have Registry access or by administrators using the built-in assoc utility. Applications can modify the file association for a given file extension to call an arbitrary program when a file with the given extension is opened.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/002)

[Screensaver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/002)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension. The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in `C:\Windows\System32\`, and `C:\Windows\sysWOW64\` on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/003)

[Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/003)

Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) event subscription. WMI can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs. Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time, user login, or the computer's uptime.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004)

[Unix Shell Configuration Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/004)

Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user�s shell. User [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/004)s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (`/etc`) and the user�s home directory (`~/`) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user�s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005)

[Trap](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/005)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal. The `trap` command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals. A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+d`.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/006)

[LC\_LOAD\_DYLIB Addition](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/006)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries. Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. The LC\_LOAD\_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies. There are tools available to perform these changes.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/007)

[Netsh Helper DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/007)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by Netsh Helper DLLs. Netsh.exe (also referred to as Netshell) is a command-line scripting utility used to interact with the network configuration of a system. It contains functionality to add helper DLLs for extending functionality of the utility. The paths to registered netsh.exe helper DLLs are entered into the Windows Registry at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Netsh`.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008)

[Accessibility Features](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/008)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/009)

[AppCert DLLs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/009)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppCert DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the `AppCertDLLs` Registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\` are loaded into every process that calls the ubiquitously used application programming interface (API) functions `CreateProcess`, `CreateProcessAsUser`, `CreateProcessWithLoginW`, `CreateProcessWithTokenW`, or `WinExec`.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/010)

[AppInit DLLs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/010)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by AppInit DLLs loaded into processes. Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are specified in the `AppInit_DLLs` value in the Registry keys `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` or `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` are loaded by user32.dll into every process that loads user32.dll. In practice this is nearly every program, since user32.dll is a very common library.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/011)

[Application Shimming](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/011)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims. The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)

[Image File Execution Options Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/012)

Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers. IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application�s IFEO will be prepended to the application�s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g., `C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g notepad.exe`).

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/013)

[PowerShell Profile](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/013)

Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles. A PowerShell profile (`profile.ps1`) is a script that runs when [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/014)

[Emond](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/014)

Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond). Emond is a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at `/sbin/emond` will load any rules from the `/etc/emond.d/rules/` directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015)

[Component Object Model Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/015)

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system. References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.

[.016](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/016)

[Installer Packages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1546/016)

Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.

[T1068](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)

[Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.

[T1574](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

[Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

[DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

[DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

[Dylib Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with `@rpath`, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable. Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB` function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

[Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

[Dynamic Linker Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as `LD_PRELOAD` on Linux or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

[Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

[Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

[Path Interception by Unquoted Path](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

[Services File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

[Services Registry Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

[COR\_PROFILER](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

Adversaries may leverage the COR\_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR\_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

[KernelCallbackTable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

Adversaries may abuse the `KernelCallbackTable` of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads. The `KernelCallbackTable` can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once `user32.dll` is loaded.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

[AppDomainManager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking how the .NET `AppDomainManager` loads assemblies. The .NET framework uses the `AppDomainManager` class to create and manage one or more isolated runtime environments (called application domains) inside a process to host the execution of .NET applications. Assemblies (`.exe` or `.dll` binaries compiled to run as .NET code) may be loaded into an application domain as executable code.

[T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)

[Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)

Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/001)

[Dynamic-link Library Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/001)

Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[Portable Executable Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/002)

Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003)

[Thread Execution Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/004)

[Asynchronous Procedure Call](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/004)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. APC injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005)

[Thread Local Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via thread local storage (TLS) callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. TLS callback injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/008)

[Ptrace System Calls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/008)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace (process trace) system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/009)

[Proc Memory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/009)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/011)

[Extra Window Memory Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/011)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012)

[Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to evade process-based defenses. Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/013)

[Process Doppelg�nging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/013)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process doppelg�nging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process doppelg�nging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/014)

[VDSO Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/014)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Virtual dynamic shared object (vdso) hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/015)

[ListPlanting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/015)

Adversaries may abuse list-view controls to inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. ListPlanting is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Code executed via ListPlanting may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

[T1053](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)

[Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.

Adversaries may abuse the [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) utility exists as an executable within Windows, Linux, and macOS for scheduling tasks at a specified time and date. Although deprecated in favor of [Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)'s [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) in Windows environments, using [at](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0110) requires that the Task Scheduler service be running, and the user to be logged on as a member of the local Administrators group.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003)

[Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003)

Adversaries may abuse the `cron` utility to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The `cron` utility is a time-based job scheduler for Unix-like operating systems. The `crontab` file contains the schedule of cron entries to be run and the specified times for execution. Any `crontab` files are stored in operating system-specific file paths.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)

[Scheduled Task](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/005)

Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0111) utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/006)

[Systemd Timers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/006)

Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Systemd timers are unit files with file extension `.timer` that control services. Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point. They can be used as an alternative to [Cron](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/003) in Linux environments. Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the `systemctl` command line utility, which operates over [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/007)

[Container Orchestration Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/007)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality provided by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to schedule deployment of containers configured to execute malicious code. Container orchestration jobs run these automated tasks at a specific date and time, similar to cron jobs on a Linux system. Deployments of this type can also be configured to maintain a quantity of containers over time, automating the process of maintaining persistence within a cluster.

[T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

[Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

[Default Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/001)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS and the default service account in Kubernetes.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

[Domain Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a domain account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

[Local Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/003)

Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a local account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.

Defense Evasion
===============

The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.

Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise. Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts. Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware. Other tactics� techniques are cross-listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.

ID

Name

Description

[T1548](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548)

[Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548)

Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001)

[Setuid and Setgid](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001)

An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user�s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively. Normally an application is run in the current user�s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)

[Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)

Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003)

[Sudo and Sudo Caching](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/003)

Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/004)

[Elevated Execution with Prompt](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/004)

Adversaries may leverage the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials. The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating. This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)

[Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005)

Adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources. Many cloud environments allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges that may be distinct from their own.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/006)

[TCC Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/006)

Adversaries can manipulate or abuse the Transparency, Consent, & Control (TCC) service or database to execute malicious applications with elevated permissions. TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).

[T1134](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134)

[Access Token Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134)

Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)

[Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)

Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using `DuplicateToken` or `DuplicateTokenEx`. The token can then be used with `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with `SetThreadToken` to assign the impersonated token to a thread.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)

[Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)

Adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as `CreateProcessWithTokenW` and `runas`.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

[Make and Impersonate Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/003)

Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the `LogonUser` function. The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use `SetThreadToken` to assign the token to a thread.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)

[Parent PID Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)

Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the `CreateProcess` API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use. This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via `svchost.exe` or `consent.exe`) rather than the current user context.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005)

[SID-History Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/005)

Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens. An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute , allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).

[T1197](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1197)

[BITS Jobs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1197)

Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) (COM). BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.

[T1612](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1612)

[Build Image on Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1612)

Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry. A remote `build` request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.

[T1622](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1622)

[Debugger Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1622)

Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid debuggers. Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.

[T1140](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)

[Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)

Adversaries may use [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027) to hide artifacts of an intrusion from analysis. They may require separate mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate that information depending on how they intend to use it. Methods for doing that include built-in functionality of malware or by using utilities present on the system.

[T1610](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)

[Deploy Container](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1610)

Adversaries may deploy a container into an environment to facilitate execution or evade defenses. In some cases, adversaries may deploy a new container to execute processes associated with a particular image or deployment, such as processes that execute or download malware. In others, an adversary may deploy a new container configured without network rules, user limitations, etc. to bypass existing defenses within the environment. In Kubernetes environments, an adversary may attempt to deploy a privileged or vulnerable container into a specific node in order to [Escape to Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611) and access other containers running on the node.

[T1006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1006)

[Direct Volume Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1006)

Adversaries may directly access a volume to bypass file access controls and file system monitoring. Windows allows programs to have direct access to logical volumes. Programs with direct access may read and write files directly from the drive by analyzing file system data structures. This technique may bypass Windows file access controls as well as file system monitoring tools.

[T1484](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)

[Domain or Tenant Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484)

Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain or identity tenant to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in centrally managed environments. Such services provide a centralized means of managing identity resources such as devices and accounts, and often include configuration settings that may apply between domains or tenants such as trust relationships, identity syncing, or identity federation.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/001)

[Group Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/001)

Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the intention of escalating privileges on the domain. Group policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD). GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predictable network path `\<DOMAIN>\SYSVOL\<DOMAIN>\Policies\`.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002)

[Trust Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1484/002)

Adversaries may add new domain trusts, modify the properties of existing domain trusts, or otherwise change the configuration of trust relationships between domains and tenants to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges.Trust details, such as whether or not user identities are federated, allow authentication and authorization properties to apply between domains or tenants for the purpose of accessing shared resources. These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication material applied to servers, tokens, and domains.

[T1480](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480)

[Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480)

Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary�s campaign. Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/001)

[Environmental Keying](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480/001)

Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment. Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Environmental keying is an implementation of [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480) that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.

[T1211](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211)

[Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211)

Adversaries may exploit a system or application vulnerability to bypass security features. Exploitation of a vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be used to disable or circumvent them.

[T1222](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222)

[File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222)

Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files. File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/001)

[Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/001)

Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files. File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002)

[Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002)

Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files. File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).

[T1564](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)

[Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)

Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Operating systems may have features to hide various artifacts, such as important system files and administrative task execution, to avoid disrupting user work environments and prevent users from changing files or features on the system. Adversaries may abuse these features to hide artifacts such as files, directories, user accounts, or other system activity to evade detection.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001)

[Hidden Files and Directories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/001)

Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms. To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a �hidden� file. These files don�t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches (`dir /a` for Windows and `ls �a` for Linux and macOS).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/002)

[Hidden Users](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/002)

Adversaries may use hidden users to hide the presence of user accounts they create or modify. Administrators may want to hide users when there are many user accounts on a given system or if they want to hide their administrative or other management accounts from other users.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/003)

[Hidden Window](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/003)

Adversaries may use hidden windows to conceal malicious activity from the plain sight of users. In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004)

[NTFS File Attributes](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004)

Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes to hide their malicious data in order to evade detection. Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition. Within MFT entries are file attributes, such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data \[known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) when more than one Data attribute is present\], that can be used to store arbitrary data (and even complete files).

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/005)

[Hidden File System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/005)

Adversaries may use a hidden file system to conceal malicious activity from users and security tools. File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage. Typically, a user engages with a file system through applications that allow them to access files and directories, which are an abstraction from their physical location (ex: disk sector). Standard file systems include FAT, NTFS, ext4, and APFS. File systems can also contain other structures, such as the Volume Boot Record (VBR) and Master File Table (MFT) in NTFS.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/006)

[Run Virtual Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/006)

Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance. Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/007)

[VBA Stomping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/007)

Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/008)

[Email Hiding Rules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/008)

Adversaries may use email rules to hide inbound emails in a compromised user's mailbox. Many email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including moving emails to other folders, marking emails as read, or deleting emails. Rules may be created or modified within email clients or through external features such as the `New-InboxRule` or `Set-InboxRule` [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) cmdlets on Windows systems.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/009)

[Resource Forking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/009)

Adversaries may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications. A resource fork provides applications a structured way to store resources such as thumbnail images, menu definitions, icons, dialog boxes, and code. Usage of a resource fork is identifiable when displaying a file�s extended attributes, using `ls -l@` or `xattr -l` commands. Resource forks have been deprecated and replaced with the application bundle structure. Non-localized resources are placed at the top level directory of an application bundle, while localized resources are placed in the `/Resources` folder.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/010)

[Process Argument Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/010)

Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory. Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process. The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process. When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/011)

[Ignore Process Interrupts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/011)

Adversaries may evade defensive mechanisms by executing commands that hide from process interrupt signals. Many operating systems use signals to deliver messages to control process behavior. Command interpreters often include specific commands/flags that ignore errors and other hangups, such as when the user of the active session logs off. These interrupt signals may also be used by defensive tools and/or analysts to pause or terminate specified running processes.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/012)

[File/Path Exclusions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/012)

Adversaries may attempt to hide their file-based artifacts by writing them to specific folders or file names excluded from antivirus (AV) scanning and other defensive capabilities. AV and other file-based scanners often include exclusions to optimize performance as well as ease installation and legitimate use of applications. These exclusions may be contextual (e.g., scans are only initiated in response to specific triggering events/alerts), but are also often hardcoded strings referencing specific folders and/or files assumed to be trusted and legitimate.

[T1574](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

[Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

[DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

[DLL Side-Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

[Dylib Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/004)

Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with `@rpath`, which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable. Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the `LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB` function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

[Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/005)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

[Dynamic Linker Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as `LD_PRELOAD` on Linux or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name. These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

[Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/007)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables used to load libraries. The PATH environment variable contains a list of directories (User and System) that the OS searches sequentially through in search of the binary that was called from a script or the command line.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

[Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/008)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

[Path Interception by Unquoted Path](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

[Services File Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/010)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

[Services Registry Permissions Weakness](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/011)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`. The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe, [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), or [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075). Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

[COR\_PROFILER](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/012)

Adversaries may leverage the COR\_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR\_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

[KernelCallbackTable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013)

Adversaries may abuse the `KernelCallbackTable` of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads. The `KernelCallbackTable` can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once `user32.dll` is loaded.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

[AppDomainManager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/014)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking how the .NET `AppDomainManager` loads assemblies. The .NET framework uses the `AppDomainManager` class to create and manage one or more isolated runtime environments (called application domains) inside a process to host the execution of .NET applications. Assemblies (`.exe` or `.dll` binaries compiled to run as .NET code) may be loaded into an application domain as executable code.

[T1562](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562)

[Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562)

Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)

[Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001)

Adversaries may modify and/or disable security tools to avoid possible detection of their malware/tools and activities. This may take many forms, such as killing security software processes or services, modifying / deleting Registry keys or configuration files so that tools do not operate properly, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. Adversaries may also disable updates to prevent the latest security patches from reaching tools on victim systems.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/002)

[Disable Windows Event Logging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/002)

Adversaries may disable Windows event logging to limit data that can be leveraged for detections and audits. Windows event logs record user and system activity such as login attempts, process creation, and much more. This data is used by security tools and analysts to generate detections.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/003)

[Impair Command History Logging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/003)

Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004)

[Disable or Modify System Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004)

Adversaries may disable or modify system firewalls in order to bypass controls limiting network usage. Changes could be disabling the entire mechanism as well as adding, deleting, or modifying particular rules. This can be done numerous ways depending on the operating system, including via command-line, editing Windows Registry keys, and Windows Control Panel.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006)

[Indicator Blocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/006)

An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. This could include maliciously redirecting or even disabling host-based sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry. These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) or [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047).

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/007)

[Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/007)

Adversaries may disable or modify a firewall within a cloud environment to bypass controls that limit access to cloud resources. Cloud firewalls are separate from system firewalls that are described in [Disable or Modify System Firewall](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/004).

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008)

[Disable or Modify Cloud Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/008)

An adversary may disable or modify cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection. Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment. If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or modify logging to avoid detection of their activities.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/009)

[Safe Mode Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/009)

Adversaries may abuse Windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses. Safe mode starts up the Windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services. Third-party security software such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools may not start after booting Windows in safe mode. There are two versions of safe mode: Safe Mode and Safe Mode with Networking. It is possible to start additional services after a safe mode boot.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)

[Downgrade Attack](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/010)

Adversaries may downgrade or use a version of system features that may be outdated, vulnerable, and/or does not support updated security controls. Downgrade attacks typically take advantage of a system�s backward compatibility to force it into less secure modes of operation.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/011)

[Spoof Security Alerting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/011)

Adversaries may spoof security alerting from tools, presenting false evidence to impair defenders� awareness of malicious activity. Messages produced by defensive tools contain information about potential security events as well as the functioning status of security software and the system. Security reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system and identifying important events that can signal a security incident.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/012)

[Disable or Modify Linux Audit System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/012)

Adversaries may disable or modify the Linux audit system to hide malicious activity and avoid detection. Linux admins use the Linux Audit system to track security-relevant information on a system. The Linux Audit system operates at the kernel-level and maintains event logs on application and system activity such as process, network, file, and login events based on pre-configured rules.

[T1656](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)

[Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)

Adversaries may impersonate a trusted person or organization in order to persuade and trick a target into performing some action on their behalf. For example, adversaries may communicate with victims (via [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), or [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)) while impersonating a known sender such as an executive, colleague, or third-party vendor. Established trust can then be leveraged to accomplish an adversary�s ultimate goals, possibly against multiple victims.

[T1070](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070)

[Indicator Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070)

Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary�s actions. Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001)

[Clear Windows Event Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/001)

Adversaries may clear Windows Event Logs to hide the activity of an intrusion. Windows Event Logs are a record of a computer's alerts and notifications. There are three system-defined sources of events: System, Application, and Security, with five event types: Error, Warning, Information, Success Audit, and Failure Audit.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/002)

[Clear Linux or Mac System Logs](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/002)

Adversaries may clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion. macOS and Linux both keep track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs. The majority of native system logging is stored under the `/var/log/` directory. Subfolders in this directory categorize logs by their related functions, such as:

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/003)

[Clear Command History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/003)

In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004)

[File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/004)

Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity. Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary (ex: [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how. Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/005)

[Network Share Connection Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/005)

Adversaries may remove share connections that are no longer useful in order to clean up traces of their operation. Windows shared drive and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) connections can be removed when no longer needed. [Net](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0039) is an example utility that can be used to remove network share connections with the `net use \system\share /delete` command.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006)

[Timestomp](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/006)

Adversaries may modify file time attributes to hide new or changes to existing files. Timestomping is a technique that modifies the timestamps of a file (the modify, access, create, and change times), often to mimic files that are in the same folder. This is done, for example, on files that have been modified or created by the adversary so that they do not appear conspicuous to forensic investigators or file analysis tools.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/007)

[Clear Network Connection History and Configurations](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/007)

Adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections in order to clean up traces of their operations. Configuration settings as well as various artifacts that highlight connection history may be created on a system and/or in application logs from behaviors that require network connections, such as [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021) or [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1133). Defenders may use these artifacts to monitor or otherwise analyze network connections created by adversaries.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/008)

[Clear Mailbox Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/008)

Adversaries may modify mail and mail application data to remove evidence of their activity. Email applications allow users and other programs to export and delete mailbox data via command line tools or use of APIs. Mail application data can be emails, email metadata, or logs generated by the application or operating system, such as export requests.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/009)

[Clear Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1070/009)

Adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity. This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables, [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112), [Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647), or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence. Adversaries may also delete accounts previously created to maintain persistence (i.e. [Create Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1136)).

[T1202](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202)

[Indirect Command Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1202)

Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106). For example, [Forfiles](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0193), the Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), Run window, or via scripts.

[T1036](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)

[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036)

Adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001)

[Invalid Code Signature](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001)

Adversaries may attempt to mimic features of valid code signatures to increase the chance of deceiving a user, analyst, or tool. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. Adversaries can copy the metadata and signature information from a signed program, then use it as a template for an unsigned program. Files with invalid code signatures will fail digital signature validation checks, but they may appear more legitimate to users and security tools may improperly handle these files.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/002)

[Right-to-Left Override](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/002)

Adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign. RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse. For example, a Windows screensaver executable named `March 25 \u202Excod.scr` will display as `March 25 rcs.docx`. A JavaScript file named `photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js` will be displayed as `photo_high_resj.png`.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003)

[Rename System Utilities](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/003)

Adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities to try to evade security mechanisms concerning the usage of those utilities. Security monitoring and control mechanisms may be in place for system utilities adversaries are capable of abusing. It may be possible to bypass those security mechanisms by renaming the utility prior to utilization (ex: rename `rundll32.exe`). An alternative case occurs when a legitimate utility is copied or moved to a different directory and renamed to avoid detections based on system utilities executing from non-standard paths.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004)

[Masquerade Task or Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004)

Adversaries may attempt to manipulate the name of a task or service to make it appear legitimate or benign. Tasks/services executed by the Task Scheduler or systemd will typically be given a name and/or description. Windows services will have a service name as well as a display name. Many benign tasks and services exist that have commonly associated names. Adversaries may give tasks or services names that are similar or identical to those of legitimate ones.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005)

[Match Legitimate Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/005)

Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/006)

[Space after Filename](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/006)

Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file. With certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/007)

[Double File Extension](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/007)

Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type. A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed (ex: `File.txt.exe` may render in some views as just `File.txt`). However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed. The real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser (ex: explorer.exe), as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system�s policies.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/008)

[Masquerade File Type](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/008)

Adversaries may masquerade malicious payloads as legitimate files through changes to the payload's formatting, including the file�s signature, extension, and contents. Various file types have a typical standard format, including how they are encoded and organized. For example, a file�s signature (also known as header or magic bytes) is the beginning bytes of a file and is often used to identify the file�s type. For example, the header of a JPEG file, is `0xFF 0xD8` and the file extension is either `.JPE`, `.JPEG` or `.JPG`.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/009)

[Break Process Trees](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/009)

An adversary may attempt to evade process tree-based analysis by modifying executed malware's parent process ID (PPID). If endpoint protection software leverages the "parent-child" relationship for detection, breaking this relationship could result in the adversary�s behavior not being associated with previous process tree activity. On Unix-based systems breaking this process tree is common practice for administrators to execute software using scripts and programs.

[T1556](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

[Modify Authentication Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

[Domain Controller Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

[Password Filter DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

[Pluggable Authentication Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is `pam_unix.so`, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

[Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

Adversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

[Reversible Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The `AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption` property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

Adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

[Hybrid Identity](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

[Network Provider DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

Adversaries may register malicious network provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to capture cleartext user credentials during the authentication process. Network provider DLLs allow Windows to interface with specific network protocols and can also support add-on credential management functions. During the logon process, Winlogon (the interactive logon module) sends credentials to the local `mpnotify.exe` process via RPC. The `mpnotify.exe` process then shares the credentials in cleartext with registered credential managers when notifying that a logon event is happening.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

[Conditional Access Policies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.

[T1578](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578)

[Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578)

An adversary may attempt to modify a cloud account's compute service infrastructure to evade defenses. A modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/001)

[Create Snapshot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/001)

An adversary may create a snapshot or data backup within a cloud account to evade defenses. A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of an existing cloud compute component such as a virtual machine (VM), virtual hard drive, or volume. An adversary may leverage permissions to create a snapshot in order to bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing compute service infrastructure, unlike in [Revert Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004) where an adversary may revert to a snapshot to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/002)

[Create Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/002)

An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine (VM) within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses. Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account. An adversary may [Create Snapshot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/001) of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect [Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005) or for [Remote Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/003)

[Delete Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/003)

An adversary may delete a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in an attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. Deleting an instance or virtual machine can remove valuable forensic artifacts and other evidence of suspicious behavior if the instance is not recoverable.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004)

[Revert Cloud Instance](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/004)

An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/005)

[Modify Cloud Compute Configurations](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1578/005)

Adversaries may modify settings that directly affect the size, locations, and resources available to cloud compute infrastructure in order to evade defenses. These settings may include service quotas, subscription associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available compute. Such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim�s compute resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution of running instances and/or revealing their activities to the victim.

[T1112](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)

[Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)

Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution.

[T1601](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601)

[Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601)

Adversaries may make changes to the operating system of embedded network devices to weaken defenses and provide new capabilities for themselves. On such devices, the operating systems are typically monolithic and most of the device functionality and capabilities are contained within a single file.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)

[Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001)

Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses. Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file. Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002)

[Downgrade System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/002)

Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security. Older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features.

[T1599](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599)

[Network Boundary Bridging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599)

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation. Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001)

[Network Address Translation Traversal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1599/001)

Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device�s Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration. Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.

[T1027](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)

[Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027)

Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/001)

[Binary Padding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/001)

Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware. This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002)

[Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002)

Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003)

[Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003)

Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information. Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/004)

[Compile After Delivery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/004)

Adversaries may attempt to make payloads difficult to discover and analyze by delivering files to victims as uncompiled code. Text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries. These payloads will need to be compiled before execution; typically via native utilities such as csc.exe or GCC/MinGW.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005)

[Indicator Removal from Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/005)

Adversaries may remove indicators from tools if they believe their malicious tool was detected, quarantined, or otherwise curtailed. They can modify the tool by removing the indicator and using the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006)

[HTML Smuggling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/006)

Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files. HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects. Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents. HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/007)

[Dynamic API Resolution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/007)

Adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve API functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. Malware commonly uses various [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions provided by the OS to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/008)

[Stripped Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/008)

Adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information. Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality. Symbols are often created by an operating system�s `linker` when executable payloads are compiled. Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009)

[Embedded Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009)

Adversaries may embed payloads within other files to conceal malicious content from defenses. Otherwise seemingly benign files (such as scripts and executables) may be abused to carry and obfuscate malicious payloads and content. In some cases, embedded payloads may also enable adversaries to [Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553) by not impacting execution controls such as digital signatures and notarization tickets.

[.010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/010)

[Command Obfuscation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/010)

Adversaries may obfuscate content during command execution to impede detection. Command-line obfuscation is a method of making strings and patterns within commands and scripts more difficult to signature and analyze. This type of obfuscation can be included within commands executed by delivered payloads (e.g., [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) and [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)) or interactively via [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059).

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/011)

[Fileless Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/011)

Adversaries may store data in "fileless" formats to conceal malicious activity from defenses. Fileless storage can be broadly defined as any format other than a file. Common examples of non-volatile fileless storage include the Windows Registry, event logs, or WMI repository.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/012)

[LNK Icon Smuggling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/012)

Adversaries may smuggle commands to download malicious payloads past content filters by hiding them within otherwise seemingly benign windows shortcut files. Windows shortcut files (.LNK) include many metadata fields, including an icon location field (also known as the `IconEnvironmentDataBlock`) designed to specify the path to an icon file that is to be displayed for the LNK file within a host directory.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013)

[Encrypted/Encoded File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013)

Adversaries may encrypt or encode files to obfuscate strings, bytes, and other specific patterns to impede detection. Encrypting and/or encoding file content aims to conceal malicious artifacts within a file used in an intrusion. Many other techniques, such as [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), [Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), and [Embedded Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009), share this same broad objective. Encrypting and/or encoding files could lead to a lapse in detection of static signatures, only for this malicious content to be revealed (i.e., [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)) at the time of execution/use.

[T1647](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647)

[Plist File Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1647)

Adversaries may modify property list files (plist files) to enable other malicious activity, while also potentially evading and bypassing system defenses. macOS applications use plist files, such as the `info.plist` file, to store properties and configuration settings that inform the operating system how to handle the application at runtime. Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD. Plist files can be saved in text or binary format.

[T1542](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542)

[Pre-OS Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542)

Adversaries may abuse Pre-OS Boot mechanisms as a way to establish persistence on a system. During the booting process of a computer, firmware and various startup services are loaded before the operating system. These programs control flow of execution before the operating system takes control.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001)

[System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001)

Adversaries may modify system firmware to persist on systems.The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) are examples of system firmware that operate as the software interface between the operating system and hardware of a computer.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/002)

[Component Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/002)

Adversaries may modify component firmware to persist on systems. Some adversaries may employ sophisticated means to compromise computer components and install malicious firmware that will execute adversary code outside of the operating system and main system firmware or BIOS. This technique may be similar to [System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/001) but conducted upon other system components/devices that may not have the same capability or level of integrity checking.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/003)

[Bootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/003)

Adversaries may use bootkits to persist on systems. Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)

[ROMMONkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/004)

Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005)

[TFTP Boot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1542/005)

Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP boot (netbooting) is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server. Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images.

[T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)

[Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)

Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/001)

[Dynamic-link Library Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/001)

Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/002)

[Portable Executable Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/002)

Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003)

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/008)

[Ptrace System Calls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/008)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace (process trace) system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/009)

[Proc Memory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/009)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/011)

[Extra Window Memory Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/011)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.012](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012)

[Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to evade process-based defenses. Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.013](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/013)

[Process Doppelg�nging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/013)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process doppelg�nging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process doppelg�nging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/014)

[VDSO Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/014)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Virtual dynamic shared object (vdso) hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[.015](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/015)

[ListPlanting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/015)

Adversaries may abuse list-view controls to inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. ListPlanting is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Code executed via ListPlanting may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

[T1620](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620)

[Reflective Code Loading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1620)

Adversaries may reflectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads. Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk (e.g., [Shared Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)).

[T1207](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1207)

[Rogue Domain Controller](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1207)

Adversaries may register a rogue Domain Controller to enable manipulation of Active Directory data. DCShadow may be used to create a rogue Domain Controller (DC). DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a DC. Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.

[T1014](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)

[Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)

Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting/hooking and modifying operating system API calls that supply system information.

[T1553](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553)

[Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553)

Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs. Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/001)

[Gatekeeper Bypass](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/001)

Adversaries may modify file attributes and subvert Gatekeeper functionality to evade user prompts and execute untrusted programs. Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple�s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host. Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more. Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002)

[Code Signing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/002)

Adversaries may create, acquire, or steal code signing materials to sign their malware or tools. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with. The certificates used during an operation may be created, acquired, or stolen by the adversary. Unlike [Invalid Code Signature](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/001), this activity will result in a valid signature.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/003)

[SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/003)

Adversaries may tamper with SIP and trust provider components to mislead the operating system and application control tools when conducting signature validation checks. In user mode, Windows Authenticode digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, variables that may be used to establish trust in signed code (ex: a driver with a valid Microsoft signature may be handled as safe). The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface (API) function, which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004)

[Install Root Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004)

Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers. Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate. Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/005)

[Mark-of-the-Web Bypass](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/005)

Adversaries may abuse specific file formats to subvert Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) controls. In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named `Zone.Identifier` with a specific value known as the MOTW. Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions. For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View. Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables. If the file is not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/006)

[Code Signing Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/006)

Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of unsigned or self-signed code. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a program from a developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on an operating system.

[T1218](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218)

[System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218)

Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed, or otherwise trusted, binaries. Binaries used in this technique are often Microsoft-signed files, indicating that they have been either downloaded from Microsoft or are already native in the operating system. Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can typically execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files or commands.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/001)

[Compiled HTML File](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/001)

[T1205](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

[Traffic Signaling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

[Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

[Socket Filters](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

[T1127](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127)

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)

[Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)

Adversaries may "pass the hash" using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003)

[Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003)

Adversaries may "pass the ticket" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

[Cloud Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/004)

Valid accounts in cloud environments may allow adversaries to perform actions to achieve Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory.

[T1497](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)

[Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497)

Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497/001)

Description

[T1557](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)

Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001)

[LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001)

By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002)

[ARP Cache Poisoning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002)

Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003)

[DHCP Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003)

Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

[T1110](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)

[Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110)

Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained. Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001)

[Password Guessing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/001)

Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002)

[Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002)

Adversaries may use password cracking to attempt to recover usable credentials, such as plaintext passwords, when credential material such as password hashes are obtained. [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) can be used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002) is not an option. Further, adversaries may leverage [Data from Configuration Repository](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602) in order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003)

[Password Spraying](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/003)

Adversaries may use a single or small list of commonly used passwords against many different accounts to attempt to acquire valid account credentials. Password spraying uses one password (e.g. 'Password01'), or a small list of commonly used passwords, that may match the complexity policy of the domain. Logins are attempted with that password against many different accounts on a network to avoid account lockouts that would normally occur when brute forcing a single account with many passwords.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/004)

[Credential Stuffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/004)

Adversaries may use credentials obtained from breach dumps of unrelated accounts to gain access to target accounts through credential overlap. Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.

[T1555](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555)

[Credentials from Password Stores](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555)

Adversaries may search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials. Passwords are stored in several places on a system, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials. There are also specific applications and services that store passwords to make them easier for users to manage and maintain, such as password managers and cloud secrets vaults. Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/001)

[Keychain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/001)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from Keychain. Keychain (or Keychain Services) is the macOS credential management system that stores account names, passwords, private keys, certificates, sensitive application data, payment data, and secure notes. There are three types of Keychains: Login Keychain, System Keychain, and Local Items (iCloud) Keychain. The default Keychain is the Login Keychain, which stores user passwords and information. The System Keychain stores items accessed by the operating system, such as items shared among users on a host. The Local Items (iCloud) Keychain is used for items synced with Apple�s iCloud service.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/002)

[Securityd Memory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/002)

An adversary with root access may gather credentials by reading `securityd`�s memory. `securityd` is a service/daemon responsible for implementing security protocols such as encryption and authorization. A privileged adversary may be able to scan through `securityd`'s memory to find the correct sequence of keys to decrypt the user�s logon keychain. This may provide the adversary with various plaintext passwords, such as those for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003)

[Credentials from Web Browsers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/003)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser. Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future. Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/004)

[Windows Credential Manager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/004)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/005)

[Password Managers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/005)

Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers. Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/006)

[Cloud Secrets Management Stores](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1555/006)

Adversaries may acquire credentials from cloud-native secret management solutions such as AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Terraform Vault.

[T1212](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)

[Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. 

[T1187](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187)

[Forced Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1187)

Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.

[T1606](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606)

[Forge Web Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606)

Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services. Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/001)

[Web Cookies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/001)

Adversaries may forge web cookies that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services. Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies to authenticate and authorize user access.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/002)

[SAML Tokens](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1606/002)

An adversary may forge SAML tokens with any permissions claims and lifetimes if they possess a valid SAML token-signing certificate. The default lifetime of a SAML token is one hour, but the validity period can be specified in the `NotOnOrAfter` value of the `conditions ...` element in a token. This value can be changed using the `AccessTokenLifetime` in a `LifetimeTokenPolicy`. Forged SAML tokens enable adversaries to authenticate across services that use SAML 2.0 as an SSO (single sign-on) mechanism.

[T1056](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)

[Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)

Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. [Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001)

[Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001)

Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them. Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured. In order to increase the likelihood of capturing credentials quickly, an adversary may also perform actions such as clearing browser cookies to force users to reauthenticate to systems.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/002)

[GUI Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/002)

Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)

[Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)

Adversaries may install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. For example, a compromised login page may log provided user credentials before logging the user in to the service.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)

[Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)

Adversaries may hook into Windows application programming interface (API) functions to collect user credentials. Malicious hooking mechanisms may capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials. Unlike [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001), this technique focuses specifically on API functions that include parameters that reveal user credentials. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:

[T1556](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

[Modify Authentication Process](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556)

Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

[Domain Controller Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/001)

Adversaries may patch the authentication process on a domain controller to bypass the typical authentication mechanisms and enable access to accounts.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

[Password Filter DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/002)

Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

[Pluggable Authentication Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/003)

Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is `pam_unix.so`, which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

[Network Device Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/004)

Adversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) to hard code a password in the operating system, thus bypassing of native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

[Reversible Encryption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/005)

An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The `AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption` property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

[Multi-Factor Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006)

Adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

[Hybrid Identity](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/007)

Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

[Network Provider DLL](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/008)

Adversaries may register malicious network provider dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to capture cleartext user credentials during the authentication process. Network provider DLLs allow Windows to interface with specific network protocols and can also support add-on credential management functions. During the logon process, Winlogon (the interactive logon module) sends credentials to the local `mpnotify.exe` process via RPC. The `mpnotify.exe` process then shares the credentials in cleartext with registered credential managers when notifying that a logon event is happening.

[.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

[Conditional Access Policies](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/009)

Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies to enable persistent access to compromised accounts. Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.

[T1111](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111)

[Multi-Factor Authentication Interception](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1111)

Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, (i.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms.

[T1621](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621)

[Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1621)

Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.

[T1040](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040)

[Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040)

Adversaries may passively sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

[T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)

[OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003)

Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password. Credentials can be obtained from OS caches, memory, or structures. Credentials can then be used to perform [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and access restricted information.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001)

[LSASS Memory](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/001)

Adversaries may attempt to access credential material stored in the process memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). After a user logs on, the system generates and stores a variety of credential materials in LSASS process memory. These credential materials can be harvested by an administrative user or SYSTEM and used to conduct [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) using [Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002)

[Security Account Manager](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/002)

Adversaries may attempt to extract credential material from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database either through in-memory techniques or through the Windows Registry where the SAM database is stored. The SAM is a database file that contains local accounts for the host, typically those found with the `net user` command. Enumerating the SAM database requires SYSTEM level access.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003)

[NTDS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/003)

Adversaries may attempt to access or create a copy of the Active Directory domain database in order to steal credential information, as well as obtain other information about domain members such as devices, users, and access rights. By default, the NTDS file (NTDS.dit) is located in `%SystemRoot%\NTDS\Ntds.dit` of a domain controller.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/004)

[LSA Secrets](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/004)

Adversaries with SYSTEM access to a host may attempt to access Local Security Authority (LSA) secrets, which can contain a variety of different credential materials, such as credentials for service accounts. LSA secrets are stored in the registry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets`. LSA secrets can also be dumped from memory.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/005)

[Cached Domain Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/005)

Adversaries may attempt to access cached domain credentials used to allow authentication to occur in the event a domain controller is unavailable.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006)

[DCSync](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/006)

Adversaries may attempt to access credentials and other sensitive information by abusing a Windows Domain Controller's application programming interface (API) to simulate the replication process from a remote domain controller using a technique called DCSync.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/007)

[Proc Filesystem](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/007)

Adversaries may gather credentials from the proc filesystem or `/proc`. The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux based systems managing virtual memory. For each process, the `/proc/<PID>/maps` file shows how memory is mapped within the process�s virtual address space. And `/proc/<PID>/mem`, exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the process�s virtual address space.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/008)

[/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/008)

Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` to enable offline password cracking. Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow` to store user account information including password hashes in `/etc/shadow`. By default, `/etc/shadow` is only readable by the root user.

[T1528](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)

[Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)

Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.

[T1649](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1649)

[Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1649)

Adversaries may steal or forge certificates used for authentication to access remote systems or resources. Digital certificates are often used to sign and encrypt messages and/or files. Certificates are also used as authentication material. For example, Azure AD device certificates and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificates bind to an identity and can be used as credentials for domain accounts.

[T1558](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558)

[Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558)

Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003). Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments. In Kerberos environments, referred to as "realms", there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC). Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting. Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001)

[Golden Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/001)

Adversaries who have the KRBTGT account password hash may forge Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGT), also known as a golden ticket. Golden tickets enable adversaries to generate authentication material for any account in Active Directory.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002)

[Silver Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/002)

Adversaries who have the password hash of a target service account (e.g. SharePoint, MSSQL) may forge Kerberos ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, also known as silver tickets. Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003)

[Kerberoasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003)

Adversaries may abuse a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or sniff network traffic to obtain a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket that may be vulnerable to [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/004)

[AS-REP Roasting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/004)

Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by [Password Cracking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110/002) Kerberos messages.

[T1539](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)

[Steal Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1539)

An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.

[T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)

[Unsecured Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552)

Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely stored credentials. These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files (e.g. [Bash History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)), operating system or application-specific repositories (e.g. [Credentials in Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)), or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. [Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001)

[Credentials In Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001)

Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing insecurely stored credentials. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)

[Credentials in Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/002)

Adversaries may search the Registry on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. The Windows Registry stores configuration information that can be used by the system or other programs. Adversaries may query the Registry looking for credentials and passwords that have been stored for use by other programs or services. Sometimes these credentials are used for automatic logons.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)

[Bash History](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/003)

Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the "history" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user�s `.bash_history` file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: `~/.bash_history`. Typically, this file keeps track of the user�s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)

[Private Keys](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004)

Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/005)

[Cloud Instance Metadata API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/005)

Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/006)

[Group Policy Preferences](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/006)

Adversaries may attempt to find unsecured credentials in Group Policy Preferences (GPP). GPP are tools that allow administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. These policies allow administrators to set local accounts.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/007)

[Container API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/007)

Adversaries may gather credentials via APIs within a containers environment. APIs in these environments, such as the Docker API and Kubernetes APIs, allow a user to remotely manage their container resources and cluster components.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/008)

[Chat Messages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/008)

Adversaries may directly collect unsecured credentials stored or passed through user communication services. Credentials may be sent and stored in user chat communication applications such as email, chat services like Slack or Teams, collaboration tools like Jira or Trello, and any other services that support user communication. Users may share various forms of credentials (such as usernames and passwords, API keys, or authentication tokens) on private or public corporate internal communications channels.

Discovery
=========

The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.

Discovery consists of techniques an adversary may use to gain knowledge about the system and internal network. These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and orient themselves before deciding how to act. They also allow adversaries to explore what they can control and what�s around their entry point in order to discover how it could benefit their current objective. Native operating system tools are often used toward this post-compromise information-gathering objective.

[T1087](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)

[Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email addresses on a system or within a compromised environment. This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, which can aid in follow-on behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers (e.g., [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/001)

[Local Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/001)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of local system accounts. This information can help adversaries determine which local accounts exist on a system to aid in follow-on behavior.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/002)

[Domain Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/002)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of domain accounts. This information can help adversaries determine which domain accounts exist to aid in follow-on behavior such as targeting specific accounts which possess particular privileges.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/003)

[Email Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/003)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of email addresses and accounts. Adversaries may try to dump Exchange address lists such as global address lists (GALs).

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/004)

[Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/004)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of cloud accounts. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application.

[T1010](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1010)

[Application Window Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1010)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of open application windows. Window listings could convey information about how the system is used. For example, information about application windows could be used identify potential data to collect as well as identifying security tooling ([Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001)) to evade.

[T1217](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217)

[Browser Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1217)

Adversaries may enumerate information about browsers to learn more about compromised environments. Data saved by browsers (such as bookmarks, accounts, and browsing history) may reveal a variety of personal information about users (e.g., banking sites, relationships/interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.

[T1580](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)

[Cloud Infrastructure Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)

An adversary may attempt to discover infrastructure and resources that are available within an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment. This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other services including the storage and database services.

[T1538](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538)

[Cloud Service Dashboard](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1538)

An adversary may use a cloud service dashboard GUI with stolen credentials to gain useful information from an operational cloud environment, such as specific services, resources, and features. For example, the GCP Command Center can be used to view all assets, findings of potential security risks, and to run additional queries, such as finding public IP addresses and open ports.

[T1526](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1526)

[Cloud Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1526)

An adversary may attempt to enumerate the cloud services running on a system after gaining access. These methods can differ from platform-as-a-service (PaaS), to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), or software-as-a-service (SaaS). Many services exist throughout the various cloud providers and can include Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Lambda Functions, Azure AD, etc. They may also include security services, such as AWS GuardDuty and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, and logging services, such as AWS CloudTrail and Google Cloud Audit Logs.

[T1619](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619)

[Cloud Storage Object Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1619)

Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure. Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage. Similar to [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) on a local host, after identifying available storage services (i.e. [Cloud Infrastructure Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1580)) adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure.

Lateral Movement
================

The adversary is trying to move through your environment.

Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and subsequently gaining access to it. Reaching their objective often involves pivoting through multiple systems and accounts to gain. Adversaries might install their own remote access tools to accomplish Lateral Movement or use legitimate credentials with native network and operating system tools, which may be stealthier.

ID

Name

Description

[T1210](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210)

[Exploitation of Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1210)

Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.

[T1534](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)

[Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)

After they already have access to accounts or systems within the environment, adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information or compromise other users within the same organization. Internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where a legitimate account is initially compromised either by controlling the user's device or by compromising the account credentials of the user. Adversaries may then attempt to take advantage of the trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking more victims into falling for phish attempts, often incorporating [Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656).

[T1570](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)

[Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. Once brought into the victim environment (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) files may then be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation.

[T1563](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563)

[Remote Service Session Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563)

Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment. Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP. When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563/001)

[SSH Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563/001)

Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to move laterally within an environment. Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems. It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563/002)

[RDP Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563/002)

Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user�s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment. Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).

[T1021](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021)

Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to interact with a remote network share using Server Message Block (SMB). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003)

[Distributed Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/003)

Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to interact with remote machines by taking advantage of Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004)

[SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004)

Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to log into remote machines using Secure Shell (SSH). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

[.005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005)

[VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005)

Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC). VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB ("remote framebuffer") protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer�s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.

[.006](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006)

[Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006)

Adversaries may use [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to interact with remote systems using Windows Remote Management (WinRM). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.

[.007](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/007)

[Cloud Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/007)

Adversaries may log into accessible cloud services within a compromised environment using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) that are synchronized with or federated to on-premises user identities. The adversary may then perform management actions or access cloud-hosted resources as the logged-on user.

[.008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/008)

[Direct Cloud VM Connections](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/008)

Adversaries may leverage [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to log directly into accessible cloud hosted compute infrastructure through cloud native methods. Many cloud providers offer interactive connections to virtual infrastructure that can be accessed through the [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009), such as Azure Serial Console, AWS EC2 Instance Connect, and AWS System Manager..

[T1091](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)

[Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)

Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.

[T1072](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072)

[Software Deployment Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072)

Adversaries may gain access to and use centralized software suites installed within an enterprise to execute commands and move laterally through the network. Configuration management and software deployment applications may be used in an enterprise network or cloud environment for routine administration purposes. These systems may also be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Examples of such solutions include: SCCM, HBSS, Altiris, AWS Systems Manager, Microsoft Intune, Azure Arc, and GCP Deployment Manager.

[T1080](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1080)

[Taint Shared Content](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1080)

Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.

[T1550](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550)

[Use Alternate Authentication Material](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550)

Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001)

[Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001)

Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)

[Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/002)

Adversaries may "pass the hash" using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.

[Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003)

Adversaries may "pass the ticket" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004)

[Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/004)

Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.

Collection
==========

The adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal.

Collection consists of techniques adversaries may use to gather information and the sources information is collected from that are relevant to following through on the adversary's objectives. Frequently, the next goal after collecting data is to steal (exfiltrate) the data. Common target sources include various drive types, browsers, audio, video, and email. Common collection methods include capturing screenshots and keyboard input.

Description

[T1557](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)

Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040), [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002), or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1212)). By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001)

[LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001)

By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002)

[ARP Cache Poisoning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/002)

Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003)

[DHCP Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/003)

Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).

[T1560](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560)

[Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560)

An adversary may compress and/or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration. Compressing the data can help to obfuscate the collected data and minimize the amount of data sent over the network. Encryption can be used to hide information that is being exfiltrated from detection or make exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/001)

[Archive via Utility](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/001)

Adversaries may use utilities to compress and/or encrypt collected data prior to exfiltration. Many utilities include functionalities to compress, encrypt, or otherwise package data into a format that is easier/more secure to transport.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/002)

[Archive via Library](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/002)

An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using 3rd party libraries. Many libraries exist that can archive data, including [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006) rarfile , libzip , and zlib . Most libraries include functionality to encrypt and/or compress data.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/003)

[Archive via Custom Method](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560/003)

An adversary may compress or encrypt data that is collected prior to exfiltration using a custom method. Adversaries may choose to use custom archival methods, such as encryption with XOR or stream ciphers implemented with no external library or utility references. Custom implementations of well-known compression algorithms have also been used.

[T1123](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1123)

[Audio Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1123)

An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., microphones and webcams) or applications (e.g., voice and video call services) to capture audio recordings for the purpose of listening into sensitive conversations to gather information.

[T1119](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119)

[Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119)

Once established within a system or network, an adversary may use automated techniques for collecting internal data. Methods for performing this technique could include use of a [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) to search for and copy information fitting set criteria such as file type, location, or name at specific time intervals.

[T1185](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1185)

[Browser Session Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1185)

Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.

[T1115](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115)

[Clipboard Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1115)

Adversaries may collect data stored in the clipboard from users copying information within or between applications.

[T1530](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530)

[Data from Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1530)

Adversaries may access data from cloud storage.

[T1602](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602)

[Data from Configuration Repository](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602)

Adversaries may collect data related to managed devices from configuration repositories. Configuration repositories are used by management systems in order to configure, manage, and control data on remote systems. Configuration repositories may also facilitate remote access and administration of devices.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/001)

[SNMP (MIB Dump)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/001)

Adversaries may target the Management Information Base (MIB) to collect and/or mine valuable information in a network managed using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/002)

[Network Device Configuration Dump](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1602/002)

Adversaries may access network configuration files to collect sensitive data about the device and the network. The network configuration is a file containing parameters that determine the operation of the device. The device typically stores an in-memory copy of the configuration while operating, and a separate configuration on non-volatile storage to load after device reset. Adversaries can inspect the configuration files to reveal information about the target network and its layout, the network device and its software, or identifying legitimate accounts and credentials for later use.

[T1213](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213)

[Data from Information Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213)

Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/001)

[Confluence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/001)

Adversaries may leverage Confluence repositories to mine valuable information. Often found in development environments alongside Atlassian JIRA, Confluence is generally used to store development-related documentation, however, in general may contain more diverse categories of useful information, such as:

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002)

[Sharepoint](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/002)

Adversaries may leverage the SharePoint repository as a source to mine valuable information. SharePoint will often contain useful information for an adversary to learn about the structure and functionality of the internal network and systems. For example, the following is a list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on SharePoint:

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/003)

[Code Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1213/003)

Adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information. Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds. They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket. Users typically interact with code repositories through a web application or command-line utilities such as git.

[T1005](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005)

[Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005)

Adversaries may search local system sources, such as file systems and configuration files or local databases, to find files of interest and sensitive data prior to Exfiltration.

[T1039](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1039)

[Data from Network Shared Drive](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1039)

Adversaries may search network shares on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from remote systems via shared network drives (host shared directory, network file server, etc.) that are accessible from the current system prior to Exfiltration. Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) may be used to gather information.

[T1025](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)

[Data from Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1025)

Adversaries may search connected removable media on computers they have compromised to find files of interest. Sensitive data can be collected from any removable media (optical disk drive, USB memory, etc.) connected to the compromised system prior to Exfiltration. Interactive command shells may be in use, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) may be used to gather information.

[T1074](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074)

[Data Staged](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074)

Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)

[Local Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/001)

Adversaries may stage collected data in a central location or directory on the local system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002)

[Remote Data Staging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1074/002)

Adversaries may stage data collected from multiple systems in a central location or directory on one system prior to Exfiltration. Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as [Archive Collected Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1560). Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106) and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.

[T1114](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114)

[Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114)

Adversaries may target user email to collect sensitive information. Emails may contain sensitive data, including trade secrets or personal information, that can prove valuable to adversaries. Adversaries can collect or forward email from mail servers or clients.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/001)

[Local Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/001)

Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information. Files containing email data can be acquired from a user�s local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/002)

[Remote Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/002)

Adversaries may target an Exchange server, Office 365, or Google Workspace to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may leverage a user's credentials and interact directly with the Exchange server to acquire information from within a network. Adversaries may also access externally facing Exchange services, Office 365, or Google Workspace to access email using credentials or access tokens. Tools such as [MailSniper](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0413) can be used to automate searches for specific keywords.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003)

[Email Forwarding Rule](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/003)

Adversaries may setup email forwarding rules to collect sensitive information. Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim�s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations. Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators. Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.

[T1056](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)

[Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056)

Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal system usage, users often provide credentials to various different locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine service (e.g. [Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001)

[Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001)

Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them. Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured. In order to increase the likelihood of capturing credentials quickly, an adversary may also perform actions such as clearing browser cookies to force users to reauthenticate to systems.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/002)

[GUI Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/002)

Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex: [Bypass User Account Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/002)).

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)

[Web Portal Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/003)

Adversaries may install code on externally facing portals, such as a VPN login page, to capture and transmit credentials of users who attempt to log into the service. For example, a compromised login page may log provided user credentials before logging the user in to the service.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)

[Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004)

Adversaries may hook into Windows application programming interface (API) functions to collect user credentials. Malicious hooking mechanisms may capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials. Unlike [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/001), this technique focuses specifically on API functions that include parameters that reveal user credentials. Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:

[T1113](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113)

[Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1113)

Adversaries may attempt to take screen captures of the desktop to gather information over the course of an operation. Screen capturing functionality may be included as a feature of a remote access tool used in post-compromise operations. Taking a screenshot is also typically possible through native utilities or API calls, such as `CopyFromScreen`, `xwd`, or `screencapture`.

[T1125](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1125)

[Video Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1125)

An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices (e.g., integrated cameras or webcams) or applications (e.g., video call services) to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information. Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.

Command and Control
===================

The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control them.

Command and Control consists of techniques that adversaries may use to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network. Adversaries commonly attempt to mimic normal, expected traffic to avoid detection. There are many ways an adversary can establish command and control with various levels of stealth depending on the victim�s network structure and defenses.

###### Techniques: 18

ID

Name

Description

[T1071](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)

[Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071)

Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)

[Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/002)

[File Transfer Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/002)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with transferring files to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/003)

[Mail Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/003)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with electronic mail delivery to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004)

[DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/004)

Adversaries may communicate using the Domain Name System (DNS) application layer protocol to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the remote system, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the client and server.

[T1092](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1092)

[Communication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1092)

Adversaries can perform command and control between compromised hosts on potentially disconnected networks using removable media to transfer commands from system to system. Both systems would need to be compromised, with the likelihood that an Internet-connected system was compromised first and the second through lateral movement by [Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091). Commands and files would be relayed from the disconnected system to the Internet-connected system to which the adversary has direct access.

[T1659](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1659)

[Content Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1659)

Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic. Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004) followed by [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189)), adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content. These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads (i.e., [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)) and other data to already compromised systems.

[T1132](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132)

[Data Encoding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132)

Adversaries may encode data to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system. Use of data encoding may adhere to existing protocol specifications and includes use of ASCII, Unicode, Base64, MIME, or other binary-to-text and character encoding systems. Some data encoding systems may also result in data compression, such as gzip.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/001)

[Standard Encoding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/001)

Adversaries may encode data with a standard data encoding system to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a standard data encoding system that adheres to existing protocol specifications. Common data encoding schemes include ASCII, Unicode, hexadecimal, Base64, and MIME. Some data encoding systems may also result in data compression, such as gzip.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/002)

[Non-Standard Encoding](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1132/002)

Adversaries may encode data with a non-standard data encoding system to make the content of command and control traffic more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) information can be encoded using a non-standard data encoding system that diverges from existing protocol specifications. Non-standard data encoding schemes may be based on or related to standard data encoding schemes, such as a modified Base64 encoding for the message body of an HTTP request.

[T1001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001)

[Data Obfuscation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001)

Adversaries may obfuscate command and control traffic to make it more difficult to detect. Command and control (C2) communications are hidden (but not necessarily encrypted) in an attempt to make the content more difficult to discover or decipher and to make the communication less conspicuous and hide commands from being seen. This encompasses many methods, such as adding junk data to protocol traffic, using steganography, or impersonating legitimate protocols.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/001)

[Junk Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/001)

Adversaries may add junk data to protocols used for command and control to make detection more difficult. By adding random or meaningless data to the protocols used for command and control, adversaries can prevent trivial methods for decoding, deciphering, or otherwise analyzing the traffic. Examples may include appending/prepending data with junk characters or writing junk characters between significant characters.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/002)

[Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/002)

Adversaries may use steganographic techniques to hide command and control traffic to make detection efforts more difficult. Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital messages that are transferred between systems. This hidden information can be used for command and control of compromised systems. In some cases, the passing of files embedded using steganography, such as image or document files, can be used for command and control.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/003)

[Protocol Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1001/003)

Adversaries may impersonate legitimate protocols or web service traffic to disguise command and control activity and thwart analysis efforts. By impersonating legitimate protocols or web services, adversaries can make their command and control traffic blend in with legitimate network traffic.

[T1568](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568)

[Dynamic Resolution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568)

Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/001)

[Fast Flux DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/001)

Adversaries may use Fast Flux DNS to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing IP addresses linked to a single domain resolution. This technique uses a fully qualified domain name, with multiple IP addresses assigned to it which are swapped with high frequency, using a combination of round robin IP addressing and short Time-To-Live (TTL) for a DNS resource record.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002)

[Domain Generation Algorithms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002)

Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/003)

[DNS Calculation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/003)

Adversaries may perform calculations on addresses returned in DNS results to determine which port and IP address to use for command and control, rather than relying on a predetermined port number or the actual returned IP address. A IP and/or port number calculation can be used to bypass egress filtering on a C2 channel.

[T1573](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573)

[Encrypted Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573)

Adversaries may employ an encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001)

[Symmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/001)

Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, and RC4.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002)

[Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002)

Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver�s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.

[T1008](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008)

[Fallback Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1008)

Adversaries may use fallback or alternate communication channels if the primary channel is compromised or inaccessible in order to maintain reliable command and control and to avoid data transfer thresholds.

[T1665](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1665)

[Hide Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1665)

Adversaries may manipulate network traffic in order to hide and evade detection of their C2 infrastructure. This can be accomplished in various ways including by identifying and filtering traffic from defensive tools, masking malicious domains to obfuscate the true destination from both automated scanning tools and security researchers, and otherwise hiding malicious artifacts to delay discovery and prolong the effectiveness of adversary infrastructure that could otherwise be identified, blocked, or taken down entirely.

[T1105](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)

[Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105)

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. Tools or files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols such as [ftp](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0095). Once present, adversaries may also transfer/spread tools between victim devices within a compromised environment (i.e. [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570)).

[T1104](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104)

[Multi-Stage Channels](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1104)

Adversaries may create multiple stages for command and control that are employed under different conditions or for certain functions. Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.

[T1095](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095)

[Non-Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1095)

Adversaries may use an OSI non-application layer protocol for communication between host and C2 server or among infected hosts within a network. The list of possible protocols is extensive. Specific examples include use of network layer protocols, such as the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), transport layer protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), session layer protocols, such as Socket Secure (SOCKS), as well as redirected/tunneled protocols, such as Serial over LAN (SOL).

[T1571](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)

[Non-Standard Port](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1571)

Adversaries may communicate using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088 or port 587 as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.

[T1572](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)

[Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572)

Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet.

[T1090](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090)

[Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090)

Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between victims to avoid suspicion. Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to further disguise the source of malicious traffic.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001)

[Internal Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/001)

Adversaries may use an internal proxy to direct command and control traffic between two or more systems in a compromised environment. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use internal proxies to manage command and control communications inside a compromised environment, to reduce the number of simultaneous outbound network connections, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths between infected systems to avoid suspicion. Internal proxy connections may use common peer-to-peer (p2p) networking protocols, such as SMB, to better blend in with the environment.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/002)

[External Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/002)

Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including [HTRAN](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0040), ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap. Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003)

[Multi-hop Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/003)

Adversaries may chain together multiple proxies to disguise the source of malicious traffic. Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy. This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/004)

[Domain Fronting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/004)

Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS. Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, "domainless" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).

[T1219](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219)

[Remote Access Software](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1219)

An adversary may use legitimate desktop support and remote access software to establish an interactive command and control channel to target systems within networks. These services, such as `VNC`, `Team Viewer`, `AnyDesk`, `ScreenConnect`, `LogMein`, `AmmyyAdmin`, and other remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, are commonly used as legitimate technical support software and may be allowed by application control within a target environment.

[T1205](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

[Traffic Signaling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205)

Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e. [Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

[Port Knocking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/001)

Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

[Socket Filters](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1205/002)

Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.

[T1102](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)

[Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system. Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001)

[Dead Drop Resolver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/001)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/002)

[Bidirectional Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/002)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to and receiving output from a compromised system over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems can then send the output from those commands back over that Web service channel. The return traffic may occur in a variety of ways, depending on the Web service being utilized. For example, the return traffic may take the form of the compromised system posting a comment on a forum, issuing a pull request to development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service, or by sending a Tweet.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/003)

[One-Way Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1102/003)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.

Exfiltration
============

The adversary is trying to steal data.

Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network. Once they�ve collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it. This can include compression and encryption. Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/003)

[Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Non-C2 Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1048/003)

Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.

[T1041](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041)

[Exfiltration Over C2 Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1041)

Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel. Stolen data is encoded into the normal communications channel using the same protocol as command and control communications.

[T1011](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1011)

[Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1011)

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a different network medium than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, the exfiltration may occur, for example, over a WiFi connection, modem, cellular data connection, Bluetooth, or another radio frequency (RF) channel.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1011/001)

[Exfiltration Over Bluetooth](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1011/001)

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over Bluetooth rather than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an adversary may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.

[T1052](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1052)

[Exfiltration Over Physical Medium](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1052)

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data via a physical medium, such as a removable drive. In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a physical medium or device introduced by a user. Such media could be an external hard drive, USB drive, cellular phone, MP3 player, or other removable storage and processing device. The physical medium or device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1052/001)

[Exfiltration over USB](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1052/001)

Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a USB connected physical device. In certain circumstances, such as an air-gapped network compromise, exfiltration could occur via a USB device introduced by a user. The USB device could be used as the final exfiltration point or to hop between otherwise disconnected systems.

[T1567](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567)

[Exfiltration Over Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to exfiltrate data rather than their primary command and control channel. Popular Web services acting as an exfiltration mechanism may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to compromise. Firewall rules may also already exist to permit traffic to these services.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/001)

[Exfiltration to Code Repository](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/001)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel. Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com). Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002)

[Exfiltration to Cloud Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/002)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a cloud storage service rather than over their primary command and control channel. Cloud storage services allow for the storage, edit, and retrieval of data from a remote cloud storage server over the Internet.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/003)

[Exfiltration to Text Storage Sites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/003)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to text storage sites instead of their primary command and control channel. Text storage sites, such as `pastebin[.]com`, are commonly used by developers to share code and other information.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/004)

[Exfiltration Over Webhook](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1567/004)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a webhook endpoint rather than over their primary command and control channel. Webhooks are simple mechanisms for allowing a server to push data over HTTP/S to a client without the need for the client to continuously poll the server. Many public and commercial services, such as Discord, Slack, and `webhook.site`, support the creation of webhook endpoints that can be used by other services, such as Github, Jira, or Trello. When changes happen in the linked services (such as pushing a repository update or modifying a ticket), these services will automatically post the data to the webhook endpoint for use by the consuming application.

[T1029](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1029)

[Scheduled Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1029)

Adversaries may schedule data exfiltration to be performed only at certain times of day or at certain intervals. This could be done to blend traffic patterns with normal activity or availability.

[T1537](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537)

[Transfer Data to Cloud Account](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1537)

Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including through sharing/syncing and creating backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service.

Impact
======

The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data.

Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data. In some cases, business processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries� goals. These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.

**Techniques**
--------------

###### Techniques: 14

ID

Name

Description

[T1531](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531)

[Account Access Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1531)

Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users. Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: changed credentials) to remove access to accounts. Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or perform a [System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529) to set malicious changes into place.

[T1485](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485)

[Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1485)

Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives. Common operating system file deletion commands such as `del` and `rm` often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.

[T1486](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)

[Data Encrypted for Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1486)

Adversaries may encrypt data on target systems or on large numbers of systems in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. They can attempt to render stored data inaccessible by encrypting files or data on local and remote drives and withholding access to a decryption key. This may be done in order to extract monetary compensation from a victim in exchange for decryption or a decryption key (ransomware) or to render data permanently inaccessible in cases where the key is not saved or transmitted.

[T1565](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565)

[Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565)

Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/001)

[Stored Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/001)

Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002)

[Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002)

Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/003)

[Runtime Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/003)

Adversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end user, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.

[T1491](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491)

[Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491)

Adversaries may modify visual content available internally or externally to an enterprise network, thus affecting the integrity of the original content. Reasons for [Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491) include delivering messaging, intimidation, or claiming (possibly false) credit for an intrusion. Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of [Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491) in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001)

[Internal Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001)

An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thus discrediting the integrity of the systems. This may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper. Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of [Internal Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/001) in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages. Since internally defacing systems exposes an adversary's presence, it often takes place after other intrusion goals have been accomplished.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002)

[External Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002)

An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users. [External Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002) may ultimately cause users to distrust the systems and to question/discredit the system�s integrity. Externally-facing websites are a common victim of defacement; often targeted by adversary and hacktivist groups in order to push a political message or spread propaganda. [External Defacement](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1491/002) may be used as a catalyst to trigger events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government. Similarly, website defacement may also be used as setup, or a precursor, for future attacks such as [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).

[T1561](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561)

[Disk Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561)

Adversaries may wipe or corrupt raw disk data on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources. With direct write access to a disk, adversaries may attempt to overwrite portions of disk data. Adversaries may opt to wipe arbitrary portions of disk data and/or wipe disk structures like the master boot record (MBR). A complete wipe of all disk sectors may be attempted.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001)

[Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001)

Adversaries may erase the contents of storage devices on specific systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002)

[Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002)

Adversaries may corrupt or wipe the disk data structures on a hard drive necessary to boot a system; targeting specific critical systems or in large numbers in a network to interrupt availability to system and network resources.

[T1499](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499)

[Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499)

Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/001)

[OS Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/001)

Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS). A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)

[Service Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/002)

Adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (DoS). Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well. Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/003)

[Application Exhaustion Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/003)

Adversaries may target resource intensive features of applications to cause a denial of service (DoS), denying availability to those applications. For example, specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive. Repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust system resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)

[Application or System Exploitation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users. Some systems may automatically restart critical applications and services when crashes occur, but they can likely be re-exploited to cause a persistent denial of service (DoS) condition.

[T1657](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657)

[Financial Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1657)

Adversaries may steal monetary resources from targets through extortion, social engineering, technical theft, or other methods aimed at their own financial gain at the expense of the availability of these resources for victims. Financial theft is the ultimate objective of several popular campaign types including extortion by ransomware, business email compromise (BEC) and fraud, "pig butchering," bank hacking, and exploiting cryptocurrency networks.

[T1495](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1495)

[Firmware Corruption](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1495)

Adversaries may overwrite or corrupt the flash memory contents of system BIOS or other firmware in devices attached to a system in order to render them inoperable or unable to boot, thus denying the availability to use the devices and/or the system. Firmware is software that is loaded and executed from non-volatile memory on hardware devices in order to initialize and manage device functionality. These devices may include the motherboard, hard drive, or video cards.

[T1490](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490)

[Inhibit System Recovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1490)

Adversaries may delete or remove built-in data and turn off services designed to aid in the recovery of a corrupted system to prevent recovery. This may deny access to available backups and recovery options.

[T1498](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498)

[Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498)

Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)

[Direct Network Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)

Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network. [Direct Network Flood](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/001)s are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. Almost any network protocol may be used for flooding. Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/002)

[Reflection Amplification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498/002)

Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target. This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.

[T1496](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496)

[Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496)

Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.

[T1489](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489)

[Service Stop](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1489)

Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users. Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the environment.

[T1529](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529)

[System Shutdown/Reboot](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1529)

Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device via [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) (e.g. `reload`).

Mobile Tactics
==============

Tactics represent the "why" of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary's tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access.

Name

Description

[T1661](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1661)

[Application Versioning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1661)

An adversary may push an update to a previously benign application to add malicious code. This can be accomplished by pushing an initially benign, functional application to a trusted application store, such as the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. This allows the adversary to establish a trusted userbase that may grant permissions to the application prior to the introduction of malicious code. Then, an application update could be pushed to introduce malicious code.

[T1456](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1456)

[Drive-By Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1456)

Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring an [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).

[T1664](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1664)

[Exploitation for Initial Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1664)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a mobile device.

[T1461](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1461)

[Lockscreen Bypass](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1461)

An adversary with physical access to a mobile device may seek to bypass the device�s lockscreen. Several methods exist to accomplish this, including:

[T1660](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660)

[Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1660)

Adversaries may send malicious content to users in order to gain access to their mobile devices. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Adversaries can conduct both non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns, as well as more targeted phishing tailored for a specific individual, company, or industry, known as "spearphishing". Phishing often involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source, as well as evasion techniques, such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages.

[T1458](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1458)

[Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1458)

Adversaries may move onto devices by exploiting or copying malware to devices connected via USB. In the case of Lateral Movement, adversaries may utilize the physical connection of a device to a compromised or malicious charging station or PC to bypass application store requirements and install malicious applications directly. In the case of Initial Access, adversaries may attempt to exploit the device via the connection to gain access to data stored on the device. Examples of this include:

[T1474](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474)

[Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474)

Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474/001)

[Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474/001)

Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Applications often depend on external software to function properly. Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474/002)

[Compromise Hardware Supply Chain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474/002)

Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474/003)

[Compromise Software Supply Chain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474/003)

Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Supply chain compromise of software can take place in a number of ways, including manipulation of the application source code, manipulation of the update/distribution mechanism for that software, or replacing compiled releases with a modified version.

Execution
=========

The adversary is trying to run malicious code.

Execution consists of techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a mobile device. Techniques that run malicious code are often paired with techniques from all other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing data.

Description

[T1623](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1623)

[Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1623)

Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, Android is a UNIX-like OS and includes a basic [Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1623/001) that can be accessed via the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or Java�s `Runtime` package.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1623/001)

[Unix Shell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1623/001)

Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the underlying command prompts on Android and iOS devices. Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges that are only accessible if the device has been rooted or jailbroken.

[T1658](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1658)

[Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1658)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to insecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries may take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.

[T1575](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1575)

[Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1575)

Adversaries may use Android�s Native Development Kit (NDK) to write native functions that can achieve execution of binaries or functions. Like system calls on a traditional desktop operating system, native code achieves execution on a lower level than normal Android SDK calls.

[T1603](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1603)

[Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1603)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. On Android and iOS, APIs and libraries exist to facilitate scheduling tasks to execute at a specified date, time, or interval.

Persistence
===========

The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold.

Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a mobile device that gives an attacker a persistent presence on the device. Attackers often will need to maintain access to mobile devices through interruptions such as device reboots and potentially even factory data resets.

[T1398](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1398)

[Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1398)

Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence. Initialization scripts are part of the underlying operating system and are not accessible to the user unless the device has been rooted or jailbroken.

[T1577](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1577)

[Compromise Application Executable](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1577)

Adversaries may modify applications installed on a device to establish persistent access to a victim. These malicious modifications can be used to make legitimate applications carry out adversary tasks when these applications are in use.

[T1645](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1645)

[Compromise Client Software Binary](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1645)

Adversaries may modify system software binaries to establish persistent access to devices. System software binaries are used by the underlying operating system and users over adb or terminal emulators.

[T1624](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1624)

[Event Triggered Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1624)

Adversaries may establish persistence using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Mobile operating systems have means to subscribe to events such as receiving an SMS message, device boot completion, or other device activities.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1624/001)

[Broadcast Receivers](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1624/001)

Adversaries may establish persistence using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Mobile operating systems have means to subscribe to events such as receiving an SMS message, device boot completion, or other device activities.

[T1541](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1541)

[Foreground Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1541)

Adversaries may abuse Android's `startForeground()` API method to maintain continuous sensor access. Beginning in Android 9, idle applications running in the background no longer have access to device sensors, such as the camera, microphone, and gyroscope. Applications can retain sensor access by running in the foreground, using Android�s `startForeground()` API method. This informs the system that the user is actively interacting with the application, and it should not be killed. The only requirement to start a foreground service is showing a persistent notification to the user.

[T1625](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1625)

[Hijack Execution Flow](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1625)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run applications. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1625/001)

[System Runtime API Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1625/001)

Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way an operating system runs applications. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence since this hijacked execution may reoccur at later points in time.

[T1603](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1603)

[Scheduled Task/Job](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1603)

Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. On Android and iOS, APIs and libraries exist to facilitate scheduling tasks to execute at a specified date, time, or interval.

Privilege Escalation
====================

The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.

Privilege escalation includes techniques that allow an attacker to obtain a higher level of permissions on the mobile device. Attackers may enter the mobile device with very limited privileges and may be required to take advantage of a device weakness to obtain higher privileges necessary to successfully carry out their mission objectives.

[T1626](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1626)

[Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1626)

Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevated privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can gain on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that are designated as higher risk. An adversary can use several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1626/001)

[Device Administrator Permissions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1626/001)

Adversaries may abuse Android�s device administration API to obtain a higher degree of control over the device. By abusing the API, adversaries can perform several nefarious actions, such as resetting the device�s password for [Endpoint Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1642), factory resetting the device for [File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/002) and to delete any traces of the malware, disabling all the device�s cameras, or to make it more difficult to uninstall the app.

[T1404](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1404)

[Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1404)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in order to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in an application, service, within the operating system software, or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructions, such as permission levels, will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques. Adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.

[T1631](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631)

[Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631)

Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses or even elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631/001)

[Ptrace System Calls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631/001)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace (process trace) system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

Defense Evasion
===============

The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.

Defense evasion consists of techniques an adversary may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses. Sometimes these actions are the same as or variations of techniques in other categories that have the added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation. Defense evasion may be considered a set of attributes the adversary applies to all other phases of the operation.

[T1407](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1407)

[Download New Code at Runtime](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1407)

Adversaries may download and execute dynamic code not included in the original application package after installation. This technique is primarily used to evade static analysis checks and pre-publication scans in official app stores. In some cases, more advanced dynamic or behavioral analysis techniques could detect this behavior. However, in conjunction with [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627) techniques, detecting malicious code downloaded after installation could be difficult.

[T1627](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627)

[Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627)

Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary�s campaign. Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include environment information such as location.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001)

[Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1627/001)

Adversaries may use a device�s geographical location to limit certain malicious behaviors. For example, malware operators may limit the distribution of a second stage payload to certain geographic regions.

[T1541](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1541)

[Foreground Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1541)

Adversaries may abuse Android's `startForeground()` API method to maintain continuous sensor access. Beginning in Android 9, idle applications running in the background no longer have access to device sensors, such as the camera, microphone, and gyroscope. Applications can retain sensor access by running in the foreground, using Android�s `startForeground()` API method. This informs the system that the user is actively interacting with the application, and it should not be killed. The only requirement to start a foreground service is showing a persistent notification to the user.

[T1628](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628)

[Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628)

Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Mobile operating systems have features and developer APIs to hide various artifacts, such as an application�s launcher icon. These APIs have legitimate usages, such as hiding an icon to avoid application drawer clutter when an application does not have a usable interface. Adversaries may abuse these features and APIs to hide artifacts from the user to evade detection.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628/001)

[Suppress Application Icon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628/001)

A malicious application could suppress its icon from being displayed to the user in the application launcher. This hides the fact that it is installed, and can make it more difficult for the user to uninstall the application. Hiding the application's icon programmatically does not require any special permissions.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628/002)

[User Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628/002)

Adversaries may attempt to avoid detection by hiding malicious behavior from the user. By doing this, an adversary�s modifications would most likely remain installed on the device for longer, allowing the adversary to continue to operate on that device.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628/003)

[Conceal Multimedia Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1628/003)

Adversaries may attempt to hide multimedia files from the user. By doing so, adversaries may conceal captured files, such as pictures, videos and/or screenshots, then later exfiltrate those files.

[T1617](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1617)

[Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1617)

Adversaries may utilize hooking to hide the presence of artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection. Hooking can be used to modify return values or data structures of system APIs and function calls. This process typically involves using 3rd party root frameworks, such as Xposed or Magisk, with either a system exploit or pre-existing root access. By including custom modules for root frameworks, adversaries can hook system APIs and alter the return value and/or system data structures to alter functionality/visibility of various aspects of the system.

[T1629](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629)

[Impair Defenses](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629)

Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. This may span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users or mobile endpoint administrators.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629/001)

[Prevent Application Removal](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629/001)

Adversaries may abuse the Android device administration API to prevent the user from uninstalling a target application. In earlier versions of Android, device administrator applications needed their administration capabilities explicitly deactivated by the user before the application could be uninstalled. This was later updated so the user could deactivate and uninstall the administrator application in one step.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629/002)

[Device Lockout](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629/002)

An adversary may seek to inhibit user interaction by locking the legitimate user out of the device. This is typically accomplished by requesting device administrator permissions and then locking the screen using `DevicePolicyManager.lockNow()`. Other novel techniques for locking the user out of the device have been observed, such as showing a persistent overlay, using carefully crafted "call" notification screens, and locking HTML pages in the foreground. These techniques can be very difficult to get around, and typically require booting the device into safe mode to uninstall the malware.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629/003)

[Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1629/003)

Adversaries may disable security tools to avoid potential detection of their tools and activities. This can take the form of disabling security software, modifying SELinux configuration, or other methods to interfere with security tools scanning or reporting information. This is typically done by abusing device administrator permissions or using system exploits to gain root access to the device to modify protected system files.

[T1630](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630)

[Indicator Removal on Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630)

Adversaries may delete, alter, or hide generated artifacts on a device, including files, jailbreak status, or the malicious application itself. These actions may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other notifications used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of mobile security solutions by causing notable events or information to go unreported.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/001)

[Uninstall Malicious Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/001)

Adversaries may include functionality in malware that uninstalls the malicious application from the device. This can be achieved by:

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/002)

[File Deletion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/002)

Adversaries may wipe a device or delete individual files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. An application must have administrator access to fully wipe the device, while individual files may not require special permissions to delete depending on their storage location.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/003)

[Disguise Root/Jailbreak Indicators](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1630/003)

An adversary could use knowledge of the techniques used by security software to evade detection. For example, some mobile security products perform compromised device detection by searching for particular artifacts such as an installed "su" binary, but that check could be evaded by naming the binary something else. Similarly, polymorphic code techniques could be used to evade signature-based detection.

[T1516](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516)

[Input Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516)

A malicious application can inject input to the user interface to mimic user interaction through the abuse of Android's accessibility APIs.

[T1655](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1655)

[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1655)

Adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. Masquerading occurs when the name, location, or appearance of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1655/001)

[Match Legitimate Name or Location](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1655/001)

Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by giving artifacts the name and icon of a legitimate, trusted application (i.e., Settings), or using a package name that matches legitimate, trusted applications (i.e., `com.google.android.gm`).

[T1575](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1575)

[Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1575)

Adversaries may use Android�s Native Development Kit (NDK) to write native functions that can achieve execution of binaries or functions. Like system calls on a traditional desktop operating system, native code achieves execution on a lower level than normal Android SDK calls.

[T1406](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406)

[Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406)

Adversaries may attempt to make a payload or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the device or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406/001)

[Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406/001)

Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information. Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406/002)

[Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406/002)

Adversaries may perform software packing to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.

[T1631](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631)

[Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631)

Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses or even elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631/001)

[Ptrace System Calls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1631/001)

Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace (process trace) system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.

[T1604](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1604)

[Proxy Through Victim](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1604)

Adversaries may use a compromised device as a proxy server to the Internet. By utilizing a proxy, adversaries hide the true IP address of their C2 server and associated infrastructure from the destination of the network traffic. This masquerades an adversary�s traffic as legitimate traffic originating from the compromised device, which can evade IP-based restrictions and alerts on certain services, such as bank accounts and social media websites.

[T1632](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1632)

[Subvert Trust Controls](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1632)

Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted applications. Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features include: an app being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate; an OS prompt alerting the user that an app came from an untrusted source; or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site. The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1632/001)

[Code Signing Policy Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1632/001)

Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of applications signed with unofficial or unknown keys. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on an app from a developer, guaranteeing that the program has not been tampered with and comes from an official source. Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on a device.

[T1633](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633)

[Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633)

Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors after checking for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware�s behavior to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the payload. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping further payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633/001)

[System Checks](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1633/001)

Adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behavior after checking for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual environment or sandbox. If the adversary detects a virtual environment, they may alter their malware�s behavior to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for virtualization artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.

Credential Access
=================

The adversary is trying to steal account names, passwords, or other secrets that enable access to resources.

Credential access represents techniques that can be used by adversaries to obtain access to or control over passwords, tokens, cryptographic keys, or other values that could be used by an adversary to gain unauthorized access to resources. Credential access allows the adversary to assume the identity of an account, with all of that account's permissions on the system and network, and makes it harder for defenders to detect the adversary. With sufficient access within a network, an adversary can create accounts for later use within the environment.

Notifications may contain sensitive data such as one-time authentication codes sent over SMS, email, or other mediums. In the case of Credential Access, adversaries may attempt to intercept one-time code sent to the device. Adversaries can also dismiss notifications to prevent the user from noticing that the notification has arrived and can trigger action buttons contained within notifications.

[T1414](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1414)

[Clipboard Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1414)

Adversaries may abuse clipboard manager APIs to obtain sensitive information copied to the device clipboard. For example, passwords being copied and pasted from a password manager application could be captured by a malicious application installed on the device.

[T1634](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1634)

[Credentials from Password Store](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1634)

Adversaries may search common password storage locations to obtain user credentials. Passwords can be stored in several places on a device, depending on the operating system or application holding the credentials. There are also specific applications that store passwords to make it easier for users to manage and maintain. Once credentials are obtained, they can be used to perform lateral movement and access restricted information.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1634/001)

[Keychain](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1634/001)

[Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417)

Adversaries may use methods of capturing user input to obtain credentials or collect information. During normal device usage, users often provide credentials to various locations, such as login pages/portals or system dialog boxes. Input capture mechanisms may be transparent to the user (e.g. [Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/001)) or rely on deceiving the user into providing input into what they believe to be a genuine application prompt (e.g. [GUI Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/002)).

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/001)

[Keylogging](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/001)

Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials or other information from the user as the user types them.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/002)

[GUI Input Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417/002)

Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for sensitive information with a seemingly legitimate prompt. The operating system and installed applications often have legitimate needs to prompt the user for sensitive information such as account credentials, bank account information, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Compared to traditional PCs, the constrained display size of mobile devices may impair the ability to provide users with contextual information, making users more susceptible to this technique�s use.

[T1635](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1635)

[Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1635)

Adversaries can steal user application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources. This can occur through social engineering or URI hijacking and typically requires user action to grant access, such as through a system "Open With" dialogue.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1635/001)

[URI Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1635/001)

Adversaries may register Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to intercept sensitive data.

Discovery
=========

The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.

Discovery consists of techniques that allow the adversary to gain knowledge about the characteristics of the mobile device and potentially other networked systems. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system may provide capabilities that aid in this post-compromise information-gathering phase.

[T1636](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636)

[Protected User Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636)

Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to collect data from permission-backed data stores on a device, such as the calendar or contact list. These permissions need to be declared ahead of time. On Android, they must be included in the application�s manifest. On iOS, they must be included in the application�s `Info.plist` file.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/001)

[Calendar Entries](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/001)

Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather calendar entry data. On Android, this can be accomplished using the Calendar Content Provider. On iOS, this can be accomplished using the `EventKit` framework.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/002)

[Call Log](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/002)

Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather call log data. On Android, this can be accomplished using the Call Log Content Provider. iOS provides no standard API to access the call log.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/003)

[Contact List](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/003)

[.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/004)

[SMS Messages](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1636/004)

Adversaries may utilize standard operating system APIs to gather SMS messages. On Android, this can be accomplished using the SMS Content Provider. iOS provides no standard API to access SMS messages.

[T1513](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1513)

[Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1513)

Adversaries may use screen capture to collect additional information about a target device, such as applications running in the foreground, user data, credentials, or other sensitive information. Applications running in the background can capture screenshots or videos of another application running in the foreground by using the Android `MediaProjectionManager` (generally requires the device user to grant consent). Background applications can also use Android accessibility services to capture screen contents being displayed by a foreground application. An adversary with root access or Android Debug Bridge (adb) access could call the Android `screencap` or `screenrecord` commands.

[T1409](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1409)

[Stored Application Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1409)

[Video Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1512)

An adversary can leverage a device�s cameras to gather information by capturing video recordings. Images may also be captured, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.

Command and Control
===================

The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised devices to control them.

The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their control within a target network. There are many ways an adversary can establish command and control with various levels of covertness, depending on system configuration and network topology. Due to the wide degree of variation available to the adversary at the network level, only the most common factors were used to describe the differences in command and control. There are still a great many specific techniques within the documented methods, largely due to how easy it is to define new protocols and use existing, legitimate protocols and network services for communication.

The resulting breakdown should help convey the concept that detecting intrusion through command and control protocols without prior knowledge is a difficult proposition over the long term. Adversaries' main constraints in network-level defense avoidance are testing and deployment of tools to rapidly change their protocols, awareness of existing defensive technologies, and access to legitimate Web services that, when used appropriately, make their tools difficult to distinguish from benign traffic.

Additionally, in the mobile environment, mobile devices are frequently connected to networks outside enterprise control such as cellular networks or public Wi-Fi networks. Adversaries could attempt to evade detection by communicating on these networks, and potentially even by using non-Internet Protocol mechanisms such as Short Message Service (SMS). However, cellular networks often have data caps and/or extra data charges that could increase the potential for adversarial communication to be detected.

ID

Name

Description

[T1437](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1437)

[Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1437)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to the mobile device, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the mobile device and server.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1437/001)

[Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1437/001)

Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with web protocols traffic to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic. Commands to remote mobile devices, and often the results of those commands, will be embedded within the protocol traffic between the mobile client and server.

[T1616](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1616)

[Call Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1616)

Adversaries may make, forward, or block phone calls without user authorization. This could be used for adversary goals such as audio surveillance, blocking or forwarding calls from the device owner, or C2 communication.

[T1637](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1637)

[Dynamic Resolution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1637)

Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. This algorithm can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1637/001)

[Domain Generation Algorithms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1637/001)

Adversaries may use [Domain Generation Algorithms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1637/001) (DGAs) to procedurally generate domain names for uses such as command and control communication or malicious application distribution.

[T1521](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521)

[Encrypted Channel](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521)

Adversaries may explicitly employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if necessary secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/001)

[Symmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/001)

Adversaries may employ a known symmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic, rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Symmetric encryption algorithms use the same key for plaintext encryption and ciphertext decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include AES, Blowfish, and RC4.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/002)

[Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/002)

Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic, rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private that should not be distributed. Due to how asymmetric algorithms work, the sender encrypts data with the receiver�s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA, ElGamal, and ECDSA.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/003)

[SSL Pinning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/003)

Adversaries may use [SSL Pinning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521/003) to protect the C2 traffic from being intercepted and analyzed.

[T1544](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1544)

[Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1544)

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system onto a compromised device to facilitate follow-on actions. Files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system through the command and control channel or through alternate protocols with another tool such as FTP.

[T1509](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1509)

[Non-Standard Port](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1509)

Adversaries may generate network traffic using a protocol and port pairing that are typically not associated. For example, HTTPS over port 8088 or port 587 as opposed to the traditional port 443. Adversaries may make changes to the standard port used by a protocol to bypass filtering or muddle analysis/parsing of network data.

[T1644](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1644)

[Out of Band Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1644)

Adversaries may communicate with compromised devices using out of band data streams. This could be done for a variety of reasons, including evading network traffic monitoring, as a backup method of command and control, or for data exfiltration if the device is not connected to any Internet-providing networks (i.e. cellular or Wi-Fi). Several out of band data streams exist, such as SMS messages, NFC, and Bluetooth.

[T1663](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1663)

[Remote Access Software](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1663)

Adversaries may use legitimate remote access software, such as `VNC`, `TeamViewer`, `AirDroid`, `AirMirror`, etc., to establish an interactive command and control channel to target mobile devices.

[T1481](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481)

[Web Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system. Popular websites and social media, acting as a mechanism for C2, may give a significant amount of cover. This is due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

[.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481/001)

[Dead Drop Resolver](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481/001)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service to host information that points to additional command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

[.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481/002)

[Bidirectional Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481/002)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service channel as a means for sending commands to and receiving output from a compromised system. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems can then send the output from those commands back over that Web service channel. The return traffic may occur in a variety of ways, depending on the Web service being utilized. For example, the return traffic may take the form of the compromised system posting a comment on a forum, issuing a pull request to development project, updating a document hosted on a Web service, or by sending a Tweet.

[.003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481/003)

[One-Way Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481/003)

Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service channel as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.

Exfiltration
============

The adversary is trying to steal data.

Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the adversary removing files and information from the targeted mobile device.

In the mobile environment, mobile devices are frequently connected to networks outside enterprise control such as cellular networks or public Wi-Fi networks. Adversaries could attempt to evade detection by communicating on these networks, and potentially even by using non-Internet Protocol mechanisms such as Short Message Service (SMS). However, cellular networks often have data caps and/or extra data charges that could increase the potential for adversarial communication to be detected.

==============

The adversary is trying to get into your ICS environment.

Initial Access consists of techniques that adversaries may use as entry vectors to gain an initial foothold within an ICS environment. These techniques include compromising operational technology assets, IT resources in the OT network, and external remote services and websites. They may also target third party entities and users with privileged access. In particular, these initial access footholds may include devices and communication mechanisms with access to and privileges in both the IT and OT environments. IT resources in the OT environment are also potentially vulnerable to the same attacks as enterprise IT systems. Trusted third parties of concern may include vendors, maintenance personnel, engineers, external integrators, and other outside entities involved in expected ICS operations. Vendor maintained assets may include physical devices, software, and operational equipment. Initial access techniques may also leverage outside devices, such as radios, controllers, or removable media, to remotely interfere with and possibly infect OT operations.

###### Techniques: 12

ID

Name

Description

[T0817](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0817)

[Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0817)

Adversaries may gain access to a system during a drive-by compromise, when a user visits a website as part of a regular browsing session. With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted and exploited simply by visiting the compromised website.

[T0819](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0819)

[Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0819)

Adversaries may leverage weaknesses to exploit internet-facing software for initial access into an industrial network. Internet-facing software may be user applications, underlying networking implementations, an assets operating system, weak defenses, etc. Targets of this technique may be intentionally exposed for the purpose of remote management and visibility.

[T0866](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0866)

[Exploitation of Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0866)

Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to take advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to enable remote service abuse. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems.

[T0822](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0822)

[External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0822)

Adversaries may leverage external remote services as a point of initial access into your network. These services allow users to connect to internal network resources from external locations. Examples are VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms. Remote service gateways often manage connections and credential authentication for these services.

[T0883](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0883)

[Internet Accessible Device](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0883)

Adversaries may gain access into industrial environments through systems exposed directly to the internet for remote access rather than through [External Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0822). Internet Accessible Devices are exposed to the internet unintentionally or intentionally without adequate protections. This may allow for adversaries to move directly into the control system network. Access onto these devices is accomplished without the use of exploits, these would be represented within the [Exploit Public-Facing Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0819) technique.

[T0886](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0886)

[Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0886)

Adversaries may leverage remote services to move between assets and network segments. These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms.

[T0847](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0847)

[Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0847)

Adversaries may move onto systems, such as those separated from the enterprise network, by copying malware to removable media which is inserted into the control systems environment. The adversary may rely on unknowing trusted third parties, such as suppliers or contractors with access privileges, to introduce the removable media. This technique enables initial access to target devices that never connect to untrusted networks, but are physically accessible.

[T0848](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0848)

[Rogue Master](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0848)

Adversaries may setup a rogue master to leverage control server functions to communicate with outstations. A rogue master can be used to send legitimate control messages to other control system devices, affecting processes in unintended ways. It may also be used to disrupt network communications by capturing and receiving the network traffic meant for the actual master. Impersonating a master may also allow an adversary to avoid detection.

[T0865](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0865)

[Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0865)

Adversaries may use a spearphishing attachment, a variant of spearphishing, as a form of a social engineering attack against specific targets. Spearphishing attachments are different from other forms of spearphishing in that they employ malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered and target a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0863) to gain execution and access.

[T0862](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0862)

[Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0862)

Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise to gain control systems environment access by means of infected products, software, and workflows. Supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products, such as devices or software, or their delivery mechanisms before receipt by the end consumer. Adversary compromise of these products and mechanisms is done for the goal of data or system compromise, once infected products are introduced to the target environment.

[T0864](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0864)

[Transient Cyber Asset](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0864)

Adversaries may target devices that are transient across ICS networks and external networks. Normally, transient assets are brought into an environment by authorized personnel and do not remain in that environment on a permanent basis. Transient assets are commonly needed to support management functions and may be more common in systems where a remotely managed asset is not feasible, external connections for remote access do not exist, or 3rd party contractor/vendor access is required.

[T0860](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0860)

[Wireless Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0860)

Adversaries may perform wireless compromise as a method of gaining communications and unauthorized access to a wireless network. Access to a wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device. Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance.

Execution
=========

The adversary is trying to run code or manipulate system functions, parameters, and data in an unauthorized way.

Execution consists of techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system, device, or other asset. This execution may also rely on unknowing end users or the manipulation of device operating modes to run. Adversaries may infect remote targets with programmed executables or malicious project files that operate according to specified behavior and may alter expected device behavior in subtle ways. Commands for execution may also be issued from command-line interfaces, APIs, GUIs, or other available interfaces. Techniques that run malicious code may also be paired with techniques from other tactics, particularly to aid network [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0102) and [Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0100), impact operations, and inhibit response functions.

Description

[T0895](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0895)

[Autorun Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0895)

Adversaries may leverage AutoRun functionality or scripts to execute malicious code. Devices configured to enable AutoRun functionality or legacy operating systems may be susceptible to abuse of these features to run malicious code stored on various forms of removeable media (i.e., USB, Disk Images \[.ISO\]). Commonly, AutoRun or AutoPlay are disabled in many operating systems configurations to mitigate against this technique. If a device is configured to enable AutoRun or AutoPlay, adversaries may execute code on the device by mounting the removable media to the device, either through physical or virtual means. This may be especially relevant for virtual machine environments where disk images may be dynamically mapped to a guest system on a hypervisor.

[T0858](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0858)

[Change Operating Mode](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0858)

Adversaries may change the operating mode of a controller to gain additional access to engineering functions such as Program Download. Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:

[T0807](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0807)

[Command-Line Interface](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0807)

Adversaries may utilize command-line interfaces (CLIs) to interact with systems and execute commands. CLIs provide a means of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many types of platforms and devices within control systems environments. Adversaries may also use CLIs to install and run new software, including malicious tools that may be installed over the course of an operation.

[T0871](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0871)

[Execution through API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0871)

Adversaries may attempt to leverage Application Program Interfaces (APIs) used for communication between control software and the hardware. Specific functionality is often coded into APIs which can be called by software to engage specific functions on a device or other software.

[T0823](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0823)

[Graphical User Interface](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0823)

Adversaries may attempt to gain access to a machine via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance execution capabilities. Access to a GUI allows a user to interact with a computer in a more visual manner than a CLI. A GUI allows users to move a cursor and click on interface objects, with a mouse and keyboard as the main input devices, as opposed to just using the keyboard.

[T0874](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0874)

[Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0874)

Adversaries may hook into application programming interface (API) functions used by processes to redirect calls for execution and privilege escalation means. Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions.

[T0821](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0821)

[Modify Controller Tasking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0821)

Adversaries may modify the tasking of a controller to allow for the execution of their own programs. This can allow an adversary to manipulate the execution flow and behavior of a controller.

[T0834](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0834)

[Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0834)

Adversaries may directly interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to access system functions. Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes. These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.

[T0853](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0853)

[Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0853)

Adversaries may use scripting languages to execute arbitrary code in the form of a pre-written script or in the form of user-supplied code to an interpreter. Scripting languages are programming languages that differ from compiled languages, in that scripting languages use an interpreter, instead of a compiler. These interpreters read and compile part of the source code just before it is executed, as opposed to compilers, which compile each and every line of code to an executable file. Scripting allows software developers to run their code on any system where the interpreter exists. This way, they can distribute one package, instead of precompiling executables for many different systems. Scripting languages, such as Python, have their interpreters shipped as a default with many Linux distributions.

[T0863](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0863)

[User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0863)

Adversaries may rely on a targeted organizations user interaction for the execution of malicious code. User interaction may consist of installing applications, opening email attachments, or granting higher permissions to documents.

Persistence
===========

The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold in your ICS environment.

Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to maintain access to ICS systems and devices across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or configuration changes that allow them to secure their ongoing activity and keep their foothold on systems. This may include replacing or hijacking legitimate code, firmware, and other project files, or adding startup code and downloading programs onto devices.

[T0891](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0891)

[Hardcoded Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0891)

Adversaries may leverage credentials that are hardcoded in software or firmware to gain an unauthorized interactive user session to an asset. Examples credentials that may be hardcoded in an asset include:

[T0889](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0889)

[Modify Program](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0889)

Adversaries may modify or add a program on a controller to affect how it interacts with the physical process, peripheral devices and other hosts on the network. Modification to controller programs can be accomplished using a Program Download in addition to other types of program modification such as online edit and program append.

[T0839](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0839)

[Module Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0839)

Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices. Control system devices often contain modular hardware devices. These devices may have their own set of firmware that is separate from the firmware of the main control system equipment.

[T0873](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0873)

[Project File Infection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0873)

Adversaries may attempt to infect project files with malicious code. These project files may consist of objects, program organization units, variables such as tags, documentation, and other configurations needed for PLC programs to function. Using built in functions of the engineering software, adversaries may be able to download an infected program to a PLC in the operating environment enabling further [Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0104) and [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0110) techniques.

[T0857](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0857)

[System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0857)

System firmware on modern assets is often designed with an update feature. Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment. When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package. It may also be possible to perform this task over the network.

[T0859](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0859)

[Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0859)

Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using credential access techniques. In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way.

Privilege Escalation
====================

The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.

Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses, misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities.

Description

[T0890](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0890)

[Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0890)

Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.

[T0874](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0874)

[Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0874)

Adversaries may hook into application programming interface (API) functions used by processes to redirect calls for execution and privilege escalation means. Windows processes often leverage these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) as exported functions.

Evasion
=======

The adversary is trying to avoid security defenses.

Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid technical defenses throughout their campaign. Techniques used for evasion include removal of indicators of compromise, spoofing communications, and exploiting software vulnerabilities. Adversaries may also leverage and abuse trusted devices and processes to hide their activity, possibly by masquerading as master devices or native software. Methods of defense evasion for this purpose are often more passive in nature.

Adversaries may change the operating mode of a controller to gain additional access to engineering functions such as Program Download. Programmable controllers typically have several modes of operation that control the state of the user program and control access to the controllers API. Operating modes can be physically selected using a key switch on the face of the controller but may also be selected with calls to the controllers API. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:

[T0820](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0820)

[Exploitation for Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0820)

Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to take advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to evade detection. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to disable or circumvent security features.

[T0872](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0872)

[Indicator Removal on Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0872)

Adversaries may attempt to remove indicators of their presence on a system in an effort to cover their tracks. In cases where an adversary may feel detection is imminent, they may try to overwrite, delete, or cover up changes they have made to the device.

[T0849](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0849)

[Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0849)

Adversaries may use masquerading to disguise a malicious application or executable as another file, to avoid operator and engineer suspicion. Possible disguises of these masquerading files can include commonly found programs, expected vendor executables and configuration files, and other commonplace application and naming conventions. By impersonating expected and vendor-relevant files and applications, operators and engineers may not notice the presence of the underlying malicious content and possibly end up running those masquerading as legitimate functions.

[T0851](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0851)

[Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0851)

Adversaries may deploy rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system, or lower.

[T0856](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0856)

[Spoof Reporting Message](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0856)

Adversaries may spoof reporting messages in control system environments for evasion and to impair process control. In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values.

[T0894](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0894)

[System Binary Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0894)

Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed, or otherwise trusted, binaries. Binaries used in this technique are often Microsoft-signed files, indicating that they have been either downloaded from Microsoft or are already native in the operating system. Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can typically execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation. Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files or commands. Similarly, on Linux systems adversaries may abuse trusted binaries such as split to proxy execution of malicious commands.

Discovery
=========

The adversary is locating information to assess and identify their targets in your environment.

Discovery consists of techniques that adversaries use to survey your ICS environment and gain knowledge about the internal network, control system devices, and how their processes interact. These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and determine next steps for target selection and Lateral Movement. They also allow adversaries to explore what they can control and gain insight on interactions between various control system processes. Discovery techniques are often an act of progression into the environment which enable the adversary to orient themselves before deciding how to act. Adversaries may use Discovery techniques that result in Collection, to help determine how available resources benefit their current objective. A combination of native device communications and functions, and custom tools are often used toward this post-compromise information-gathering objective.

Description

[T0840](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0840)

[Network Connection Enumeration](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0840)

Adversaries may perform network connection enumeration to discover information about device communication patterns. If an adversary can inspect the state of a network connection with tools, such as Netstat, in conjunction with [System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0857), then they can determine the role of certain devices on the network . The adversary can also use [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0842) to watch network traffic for details about the source, destination, protocol, and content.

[T0842](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0842)

[Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0842)

Network sniffing is the practice of using a network interface on a computer system to monitor or capture information regardless of whether it is the specified destination for the information.

[T0846](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0846)

[Remote System Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0846)

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of other systems by IP address, hostname, or other logical identifier on a network that may be used for subsequent Lateral Movement or Discovery techniques. Functionality could exist within adversary tools to enable this, but utilities available on the operating system or vendor software could also be used.

[T0888](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0888)

[Remote System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0888)

An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about remote systems and their peripherals, such as make/model, role, and configuration. Adversaries may use information from Remote System Information Discovery to aid in targeting and shaping follow-on behaviors. For example, the system's operational role and model information can dictate whether it is a relevant target for the adversary's operational objectives. In addition, the system's configuration may be used to scope subsequent technique usage.

[T0887](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0887)

[Wireless Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0887)

Adversaries may seek to capture radio frequency (RF) communication used for remote control and reporting in distributed environments. RF communication frequencies vary between 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although are commonly between 300 MHz to 6 GHz. The wavelength and frequency of the signal affect how the signal propagates through open air, obstacles (e.g. walls and trees) and the type of radio required to capture them. These characteristics are often standardized in the protocol and hardware and may have an effect on how the signal is captured. Some examples of wireless protocols that may be found in cyber-physical environments are: WirelessHART, Zigbee, WIA-FA, and 700 MHz Public Safety Spectrum.

Lateral Movement
================

The adversary is trying to move through your ICS environment.

Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. These techniques abuse default credentials, known accounts, and vulnerable services, and may also leverage dual-homed devices and systems that reside on both the IT and OT networks. The adversary uses these techniques to pivot to their next point in the environment, positioning themselves to where they want to be or think they should be. Following through on their primary objective often requires [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0102) of the network and [Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0100) to develop awareness of unique ICS devices and processes, in order to find their target and subsequently gain access to it. Reaching this objective often involves pivoting through multiple systems, devices, and accounts. Adversaries may install their own remote tools to accomplish Lateral Movement or leverage default tools, programs, and manufacturer set or other legitimate credentials native to the network, which may be stealthier.

[T0812](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0812)

[Default Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0812)

Adversaries may leverage manufacturer or supplier set default credentials on control system devices. These default credentials may have administrative permissions and may be necessary for initial configuration of the device. It is general best practice to change the passwords for these accounts as soon as possible, but some manufacturers may have devices that have passwords or usernames that cannot be changed.

[T0866](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0866)

[Exploitation of Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0866)

Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to take advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to enable remote service abuse. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for initial access into and lateral movement throughout the ICS environment to enable access to targeted systems.

[T0891](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0891)

[Hardcoded Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0891)

Adversaries may leverage credentials that are hardcoded in software or firmware to gain an unauthorized interactive user session to an asset. Examples credentials that may be hardcoded in an asset include:

[T0867](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0867)

[Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0867)

Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Copying of files may also be performed laterally between internal victim systems to support Lateral Movement with remote Execution using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB to connected network shares.

[T0843](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0843)

[Program Download](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0843)

Adversaries may perform a program download to transfer a user program to a controller.

[T0886](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0886)

[Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0886)

Adversaries may leverage remote services to move between assets and network segments. These services are often used to allow operators to interact with systems remotely within the network, some examples are RDP, SMB, SSH, and other similar mechanisms.

[T0859](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0859)

[Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0859)

Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using credential access techniques. In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way.

Collection
==========

The adversary is trying to gather data of interest and domain knowledge on your ICS environment to inform their goal.

Collection consists of techniques adversaries use to gather domain knowledge and obtain contextual feedback in an ICS environment. This tactic is often performed as part of [Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0102), to compile data on control systems and targets of interest that may be used to follow through on the adversary�s objective. Examples of these techniques include observing operation states, capturing screenshots, identifying unique device roles, and gathering system and diagram schematics. Collection of this data can play a key role in planning, executing, and even revising an ICS-targeted attack. Methods of collection depend on the categories of data being targeted, which can include protocol specific, device specific, and process specific configurations and functionality. Information collected may pertain to a combination of system, supervisory, device, and network related data, which conceptually fall under high, medium, and low levels of plan operations. For example, information repositories on plant data at a high level or device specific programs at a low level. Sensitive floor plans, vendor device manuals, and other references may also be at risk and exposed on the internet or otherwise publicly accessible.

Description

[T0830](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0830)

[Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0830)

Adversaries with privileged network access may seek to modify network traffic in real time using adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks. This type of attack allows the adversary to intercept traffic to and/or from a particular device on the network. If a AiTM attack is established, then the adversary has the ability to block, log, modify, or inject traffic into the communication stream. There are several ways to accomplish this attack, but some of the most-common are Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning and the use of a proxy.

[T0802](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0802)

[Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0802)

Adversaries may automate collection of industrial environment information using tools or scripts. This automated collection may leverage native control protocols and tools available in the control systems environment. For example, the OPC protocol may be used to enumerate and gather information. Access to a system or interface with these native protocols may allow collection and enumeration of other attached, communicating servers and devices.

[T0811](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0811)

[Data from Information Repositories](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0811)

Adversaries may target and collect data from information repositories. This can include sensitive data such as specifications, schematics, or diagrams of control system layouts, devices, and processes. Examples of information repositories include reference databases in the process environment, as well as databases in the corporate network that might contain information about the ICS.

[T0893](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0893)

[Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0893)

Adversaries may target and collect data from local system sources, such as file systems, configuration files, or local databases. This can include sensitive data such as specifications, schematics, or diagrams of control system layouts, devices, and processes.

[T0868](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0868)

[Detect Operating Mode](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0868)

Adversaries may gather information about a PLCs or controllers current operating mode. Operating modes dictate what change or maintenance functions can be manipulated and are often controlled by a key switch on the PLC (e.g., run, prog \[program\], and remote). Knowledge of these states may be valuable to an adversary to determine if they are able to reprogram the PLC. Operating modes and the mechanisms by which they are selected often vary by vendor and product line. Some commonly implemented operating modes are described below:

[T0877](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0877)

[I/O Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0877)

Adversaries may seek to capture process values related to the inputs and outputs of a PLC. During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules.

[T0801](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0801)

[Monitor Process State](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0801)

Adversaries may gather information about the physical process state. This information may be used to gain more information about the process itself or used as a trigger for malicious actions. The sources of process state information may vary such as, OPC tags, historian data, specific PLC block information, or network traffic.

[T0861](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0861)

[Point & Tag Identification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0861)

Adversaries may collect point and tag values to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the process environment. Points may be values such as inputs, memory locations, outputs or other process specific variables. Tags are the identifiers given to points for operator convenience.

[T0845](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0845)

[Program Upload](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0845)

Adversaries may attempt to upload a program from a PLC to gather information about an industrial process. Uploading a program may allow them to acquire and study the underlying logic. Methods of program upload include vendor software, which enables the user to upload and read a program running on a PLC. This software can be used to upload the target program to a workstation, jump box, or an interfacing device.

[T0852](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0852)

[Screen Capture](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0852)

Adversaries may attempt to perform screen capture of devices in the control system environment. Screenshots may be taken of workstations, HMIs, or other devices that display environment-relevant process, device, reporting, alarm, or related data. These device displays may reveal information regarding the ICS process, layout, control, and related schematics. In particular, an HMI can provide a lot of important industrial process information. Analysis of screen captures may provide the adversary with an understanding of intended operations and interactions between critical devices.

[T0887](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0887)

[Wireless Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0887)

Adversaries may seek to capture radio frequency (RF) communication used for remote control and reporting in distributed environments. RF communication frequencies vary between 3 kHz to 300 GHz, although are commonly between 300 MHz to 6 GHz. The wavelength and frequency of the signal affect how the signal propagates through open air, obstacles (e.g. walls and trees) and the type of radio required to capture them. These characteristics are often standardized in the protocol and hardware and may have an effect on how the signal is captured. Some examples of wireless protocols that may be found in cyber-physical environments are: WirelessHART, Zigbee, WIA-FA, and 700 MHz Public Safety Spectrum.

Command and Control
===================

The adversary is trying to communicate with and control compromised systems, controllers, and platforms with access to your ICS environment.

Command and Control consists of techniques that adversaries use to communicate with and send commands to compromised systems, devices, controllers, and platforms with specialized applications used in ICS environments. Examples of these specialized communication devices include human machine interfaces (HMIs), data historians, SCADA servers, and engineering workstations (EWS). Adversaries often seek to use commonly available resources and mimic expected network traffic to avoid detection and suspicion. For instance, commonly used ports and protocols in ICS environments, and even expected IT resources, depending on the target network. Command and Control may be established to varying degrees of stealth, often depending on the victim�s network structure and defenses.

Description

[T0885](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0885)

[Commonly Used Port](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0885)

Adversaries may communicate over a commonly used port to bypass firewalls or network detection systems and to blend in with normal network activity, to avoid more detailed inspection. They may use the protocol associated with the port, or a completely different protocol. They may use commonly open ports, such as the examples provided below.

[T0884](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0884)

[Connection Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0884)

Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between systems or act as an intermediary for network communications.

[T0869](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0869)

[Standard Application Layer Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0869)

Adversaries may establish command and control capabilities over commonly used application layer protocols such as HTTP(S), OPC, RDP, telnet, DNP3, and modbus. These protocols may be used to disguise adversary actions as benign network traffic. Standard protocols may be seen on their associated port or in some cases over a non-standard port. Adversaries may use these protocols to reach out of the network for command and control, or in some cases to other infected devices within the network.

Inhibit Response Function
=========================

The adversary is trying to prevent your safety, protection, quality assurance, and operator intervention functions from responding to a failure, hazard, or unsafe state.

Inhibit Response Function consists of techniques that adversaries use to hinder the safeguards put in place for processes and products. This may involve the inhibition of safety, protection, quality assurance, or operator intervention functions to disrupt safeguards that aim to prevent the loss of life, destruction of equipment, and disruption of production. These techniques aim to actively deter and prevent expected alarms and responses that arise due to statuses in the ICS environment. Adversaries may modify or update system logic, or even outright prevent responses with a denial-of-service. They may result in the prevention, destruction, manipulation, or modification of programs, logic, devices, and communications. As prevention functions are generally dormant, reporting and processing functions can appear fine, but may have been altered to prevent failure responses in dangerous scenarios. Unlike [Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0103), Inhibit Response Function techniques may be more intrusive, such as actively preventing responses to a known dangerous scenario. Adversaries may use these techniques to follow through with or provide cover for [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0105) techniques.

Description

[T0800](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0800)

[Activate Firmware Update Mode](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0800)

Adversaries may activate firmware update mode on devices to prevent expected response functions from engaging in reaction to an emergency or process malfunction. For example, devices such as protection relays may have an operation mode designed for firmware installation. This mode may halt process monitoring and related functions to allow new firmware to be loaded. A device left in update mode may be placed in an inactive holding state if no firmware is provided to it. By entering and leaving a device in this mode, the adversary may deny its usual functionalities.

[T0878](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0878)

[Alarm Suppression](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0878)

Adversaries may target protection function alarms to prevent them from notifying operators of critical conditions. Alarm messages may be a part of an overall reporting system and of particular interest for adversaries. Disruption of the alarm system does not imply the disruption of the reporting system as a whole.

[T0803](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0803)

[Block Command Message](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0803)

Adversaries may block a command message from reaching its intended target to prevent command execution. In OT networks, command messages are sent to provide instructions to control system devices. A blocked command message can inhibit response functions from correcting a disruption or unsafe condition.

[T0804](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0804)

[Block Reporting Message](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0804)

Adversaries may block or prevent a reporting message from reaching its intended target. In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. By blocking these reporting messages, an adversary can potentially hide their actions from an operator.

[T0805](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0805)

[Block Serial COM](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0805)

Adversaries may block access to serial COM to prevent instructions or configurations from reaching target devices. Serial Communication ports (COM) allow communication with control system devices. Devices can receive command and configuration messages over such serial COM. Devices also use serial COM to send command and reporting messages. Blocking device serial COM may also block command messages and block reporting messages.

[T0892](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0892)

[Change Credential](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0892)

Adversaries may modify software and device credentials to prevent operator and responder access. Depending on the device, the modification or addition of this password could prevent any device configuration actions from being accomplished and may require a factory reset or replacement of hardware. These credentials are often built-in features provided by the device vendors as a means to restrict access to management interfaces.

[T0809](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0809)

[Data Destruction](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0809)

Adversaries may perform data destruction over the course of an operation. The adversary may drop or create malware, tools, or other non-native files on a target system to accomplish this, potentially leaving behind traces of malicious activities. Such non-native files and other data may be removed over the course of an intrusion to maintain a small footprint or as a standard part of the post-intrusion cleanup process.

[T0814](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0814)

[Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0814)

Adversaries may perform Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to disrupt expected device functionality. Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment.

[T0816](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0816)

[Device Restart/Shutdown](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0816)

Adversaries may forcibly restart or shutdown a device in an ICS environment to disrupt and potentially negatively impact physical processes. Methods of device restart and shutdown exist in some devices as built-in, standard functionalities. These functionalities can be executed using interactive device web interfaces, CLIs, and network protocol commands.

[T0835](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0835)

[Manipulate I/O Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0835)

Adversaries may manipulate the I/O image of PLCs through various means to prevent them from functioning as expected. Methods of I/O image manipulation may include overriding the I/O table via direct memory manipulation or using the override function used for testing PLC programs. During the scan cycle, a PLC reads the status of all inputs and stores them in an image table. The image table is the PLCs internal storage location where values of inputs/outputs for one scan are stored while it executes the user program. After the PLC has solved the entire logic program, it updates the output image table. The contents of this output image table are written to the corresponding output points in I/O Modules.

[T0838](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0838)

[Modify Alarm Settings](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0838)

Adversaries may modify alarm settings to prevent alerts that may inform operators of their presence or to prevent responses to dangerous and unintended scenarios. Reporting messages are a standard part of data acquisition in control systems. Reporting messages are used as a way to transmit system state information and acknowledgements that specific actions have occurred. These messages provide vital information for the management of a physical process, and keep operators, engineers, and administrators aware of the state of system devices and physical processes.

[T0851](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0851)

[Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0851)

Adversaries may deploy rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components. Rootkits are programs that hide the existence of malware by intercepting and modifying operating-system API calls that supply system information. Rootkits or rootkit-enabling functionality may reside at the user or kernel level in the operating system, or lower.

[T0881](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0881)

[Service Stop](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0881)

Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users. Stopping critical services can inhibit or stop response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the environment. Services may not allow for modification of their data stores while running. Adversaries may stop services in order to conduct Data Destruction.

[T0857](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0857)

[System Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0857)

System firmware on modern assets is often designed with an update feature. Older device firmware may be factory installed and require special reprograming equipment. When available, the firmware update feature enables vendors to remotely patch bugs and perform upgrades. Device firmware updates are often delegated to the user and may be done using a software update package. It may also be possible to perform this task over the network.

Impair Process Control
======================

The adversary is trying to manipulate, disable, or damage physical control processes.

Impair Process Control consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt control logic and cause determinantal effects to processes being controlled in the target environment. Targets of interest may include active procedures or parameters that manipulate the physical environment. These techniques can also include prevention or manipulation of reporting elements and control logic. If an adversary has modified process functionality, then they may also obfuscate the results, which are often self-revealing in their impact on the outcome of a product or the environment. The direct physical control these techniques exert may also threaten the safety of operators and downstream users, which can prompt response mechanisms. Adversaries may follow up with or use [Inhibit Response Function](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0107) techniques in tandem, to assist with the successful abuse of control processes to result in [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0105).

Description

[T0806](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0806)

[Brute Force I/O](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0806)

Adversaries may repetitively or successively change I/O point values to perform an action. Brute Force I/O may be achieved by changing either a range of I/O point values or a single point value repeatedly to manipulate a process function. The adversary's goal and the information they have about the target environment will influence which of the options they choose. In the case of brute forcing a range of point values, the adversary may be able to achieve an impact without targeting a specific point. In the case where a single point is targeted, the adversary may be able to generate instability on the process function associated with that particular point.

[T0836](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0836)

[Modify Parameter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0836)

Adversaries may modify parameters used to instruct industrial control system devices. These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.

[T0839](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0839)

[Module Firmware](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0839)

Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices. Control system devices often contain modular hardware devices. These devices may have their own set of firmware that is separate from the firmware of the main control system equipment.

[T0856](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0856)

[Spoof Reporting Message](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0856)

Adversaries may spoof reporting messages in control system environments for evasion and to impair process control. In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values.

[T0855](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0855)

[Unauthorized Command Message](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0855)

Adversaries may send unauthorized command messages to instruct control system assets to perform actions outside of their intended functionality, or without the logical preconditions to trigger their expected function. Command messages are used in ICS networks to give direct instructions to control systems devices. If an adversary can send an unauthorized command message to a control system, then it can instruct the control systems device to perform an action outside the normal bounds of the device's actions. An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0105).

Impact
======

The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your ICS systems, data, and their surrounding environment.

Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt, compromise, destroy, and manipulate the integrity and availability of control system operations, processes, devices, and data. These techniques encompass the influence and effects resulting from adversarial efforts to attack the ICS environment or that tangentially impact it. Impact techniques can result in more instantaneous disruption to control processes and the operator, or may result in more long term damage or loss to the ICS environment and related operations. The adversary may leverage [Impair Process Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0106) techniques, which often manifest in more self-revealing impacts on operations, or [Impair Process Control](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0106) techniques to hinder safeguards and alarms in order to follow through with and provide cover for Impact. In some scenarios, control system processes can appear to function as expected, but may have been altered to benefit the adversary�s goal over the course of a longer duration. These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.

[Loss of Productivity and Revenue](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0828), [Theft of Operational Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0882), and [Damage to Property](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0879) are meant to encompass some of the more granular goals of adversaries in targeted and untargeted attacks. These techniques in and of themselves are not necessarily detectable, but the associated adversary behavior can potentially be mitigated and/or detected.

Description

[T0879](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0879)

[Damage to Property](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0879)

Adversaries may cause damage and destruction of property to infrastructure, equipment, and the surrounding environment when attacking control systems. This technique may result in device and operational equipment breakdown, or represent tangential damage from other techniques used in an attack. Depending on the severity of physical damage and disruption caused to control processes and systems, this technique may result in [Loss of Safety](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0880). Operations that result in [Loss of Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0827) may also cause damage to property, which may be directly or indirectly motivated by an adversary seeking to cause impact in the form of [Loss of Productivity and Revenue](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0828).

[T0813](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0813)

[Denial of Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0813)

Adversaries may cause a denial of control to temporarily prevent operators and engineers from interacting with process controls. An adversary may attempt to deny process control access to cause a temporary loss of communication with the control device or to prevent operator adjustment of process controls. An affected process may still be operating during the period of control loss, but not necessarily in a desired state.

[T0815](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0815)

[Denial of View](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0815)

Adversaries may cause a denial of view in attempt to disrupt and prevent operator oversight on the status of an ICS environment. This may manifest itself as a temporary communication failure between a device and its control source, where the interface recovers and becomes available once the interference ceases.

[T0826](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0826)

[Loss of Availability](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0826)

Adversaries may attempt to disrupt essential components or systems to prevent owner and operator from delivering products or services.

[T0827](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0827)

[Loss of Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0827)

Adversaries may seek to achieve a sustained loss of control or a runaway condition in which operators cannot issue any commands even if the malicious interference has subsided.

[T0828](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0828)

[Loss of Productivity and Revenue](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0828)

Adversaries may cause loss of productivity and revenue through disruption and even damage to the availability and integrity of control system operations, devices, and related processes. This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments.

[T0837](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0837)

[Loss of Protection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0837)

Adversaries may compromise protective system functions designed to prevent the effects of faults and abnormal conditions. This can result in equipment damage, prolonged process disruptions and hazards to personnel.

[T0880](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0880)

[Loss of Safety](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0880)

Adversaries may compromise safety system functions designed to maintain safe operation of a process when unacceptable or dangerous conditions occur. Safety systems are often composed of the same elements as control systems but have the sole purpose of ensuring the process fails in a predetermined safe manner.

[T0829](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0829)

[Loss of View](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0829)

Adversaries may cause a sustained or permanent loss of view where the ICS equipment will require local, hands-on operator intervention; for instance, a restart or manual operation. By causing a sustained reporting or visibility loss, the adversary can effectively hide the present state of operations. This loss of view can occur without affecting the physical processes themselves.

[T0831](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0831)

[Manipulation of Control](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0831)

Adversaries may manipulate physical process control within the industrial environment. Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes. The duration of manipulation may be temporary or longer sustained, depending on operator detection.

[T0832](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0832)

[Manipulation of View](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0832)

Adversaries may attempt to manipulate the information reported back to operators or controllers. This manipulation may be short term or sustained. During this time the process itself could be in a much different state than what is reported.

[T0882](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0882)

[Theft of Operational Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T0882)

Adversaries may steal operational information on a production environment as a direct mission outcome for personal gain or to inform future operations. This information may include design documents, schedules, rotational data, or similar artifacts that provide insight on operations. In the Bowman Dam incident, adversaries probed systems for operational data.
